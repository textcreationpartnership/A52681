            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Honourable, <hi>SIR,</hi> IOHN SETON OF GARLETON, Son to Lord <hi>GEORGE, Late Earl of</hi> WINTON.</head>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE great Obligations, I had to your Honour afore I parted from <hi>Scotland,</hi> claim with much reaſon to ſome Fruit of my Labour. Be pleaſed then to accept of a little work of mine from <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am confident the Subject will pleaſe
<pb facs="tcp:44999:3"/>
you, becauſe it is ſutable to your Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the piety of your moſt Noble and ancient Family.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour by the occaſion of the Jews ſeeking him for Bread, ſpoke to them of the Bread of Life, and I, by the occaſion of three ſheafs of Corn, I find in your Scutchion, or in the Honours of your Houſe, will ſpeak to you, in reference to the Subject of this little Book, of the Bread, termed by the Church, <hi>the Bread of the ſtrong,</hi> I mean of the moſt Holy Sacrifice, and Sacrament of the Altar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ligor ne diſpergar</hi> ſaycs your <hi>motto, I am bound lest I ſcatter,</hi> your glorious anceſtors being united and tyed together in the Faith of this Sacrament, were not ſcattered by the Enemies of their Souve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, when helped by the miraculous valour in a Child of the houſe of <hi>Duglas,</hi> they galantly brought Queen <hi>Mary</hi> out of the Bondage of <hi>Lockleven,</hi> and lodged Her ſafely the firſt night in my Lord SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON'S own Houſe at <hi>Netheree</hi> in Weſt <hi>Lothian.</hi> They keeping ſtill Faith to God and their Soveraigns, after this action
<pb facs="tcp:44999:3"/>
ſpread even under Perſecution, as <hi>Cama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moile</hi> trodden down, both to more Wealth and Honour.</p>
            <p>'Twas for the Vertue of the SETON'S, that Noble Motto <hi>invia virtuti via nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, no way hard or unpaſſible to Vertue,</hi> was given them. And where, I pray, in their perſwaſion then, and ſtill in yours is the ſeat of Vertue but in this Bread of the ſtrong?</p>
            <p>If the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> refreſhed with that Bread, which was only a Figure of our Sacrament, walked fourty days and as many nights, wonder you that thoſe great Men, of whom you have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to deſcend, receiving it often were quickned to generoſity, and Chriſtian Duty to King and Country?</p>
            <p>Sir CHRISTOFER SETON by RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT A BRUCE, ſutnamed <hi>the Good,</hi> merited for his Devotion to the Sacrifice of the Maſs, to have after his Death the daily Sacrifice offered for him, and this was perform'd by the ſame King ROBERT, whoſe Siſter he had Married, for he found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Chapel near <hi>Dumfrice,</hi> call'd <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel</hi>

Chappel, and a Preiſt to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in it for the Soul of <hi>Good Sir Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stofer,</hi> as he out of a loving reſpect was pleaſed to call him. This renowned Champion dyed at <hi>London</hi> as Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as Cruelly by the hands of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> whom he had often ſtoutly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and peſtured in the ſervice of his Country.</p>
            <p>But why was <hi>Chriſtofer</hi> the firſt his Predeceſſor call'd more Devout than Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? But becauſe his Heart was power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ully, tho ſweetly, drawn to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as Iron to a Load-Stone? <hi>Hoc ſpecialiter,</hi> ſayes <hi>Thomas a Kempis l</hi> 4. <hi>de imit. Ch. c.</hi> 1. <hi>Devotorum corda tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hit, this Sacrament draws by a ſpecial way the hearts of Devout People;</hi> and thus from a ſpecial reſpect to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament a Man worthily obtaines the tittle of Devout.</p>
            <p>Lord <hi>George</hi> the third a Prudent Man, and very Familiar with King <hi>James</hi> the third, devided his Devotion to the Altar with his Lady Dame <hi>Jeane Hepburn,</hi> called by the Hiſtory a Noble and Wiſe

Were not thoſe two great Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with the ſame Zeal, when ſtriving as it were who might do beſt, they ſet themſelves to decore the Colledg-Church of SETON?</p>
            <p>The Lord paved and ſeiled the quire; and the Lady <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aiſed an Ile on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and having taken down that on the the South ſide, Built by the Devotion of Dame <hi>Catherine Sinclar,</hi> rebuilded it again with proportion to make a perfit Croſs, and founded two Prebends to ſerve the Altars. The Lord, not to ſpeak of other Ornaments, gave it a compleat Sute of Cloth of Gold: And the Lady compleat Sutes of all the Colours of the Church, for Advent, Lent, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Virgins; for all the ſolemn Feaſts of the Year of Purple and Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Velvet richly flower'd with Gold, white Damask, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not forgetting a Sute of black Veſtiments for the Dead with other fine Chaſubels.

            <p>Some may think I had done better in a Dedicatory, to buſie my Pen in deſcribing the Courage of a Governour of <hi>Barwick</hi> of the Houſe of SETON, who in cold Blood chuſed rather to ſee his Son violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put to Death, than to faile in his truſt to King and Country, and in ſuch like ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al actions admired by Men, than in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſing theſe liberalities made to the Altar, which are but petty things in the Eyes of worlings.</p>
            <p>But my ayme is not ſo much to ſhew the worly grandeur of your Family, as the Devotion to this Myſtery, (which makes the Subject of my Book) of the great ones in it. This their Devotion made them truly great. Take from a Man the ſenſe and reſpect he has for God, and for what relates to him, and what is he with all he has, or may poſſeſs? little, a nothing an object of contempt. As God diſmaly
<pb facs="tcp:44999:5"/>

Live then for ever Souls nobly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to contribute to the Majeſty of this daily Sacrifice, which is upon Earth God's greateſt Glory.</p>
            <p>O change of times and manners! where is he or ſhe in <hi>Scotland</hi> now a dayes, who make it their ſtudy to imitate thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Noble Perſons? What a loſs is the want of ſuch for the Houſe of God! How many poor Families, monaſteries Churches, and Altars mourned at the Death, eſpecially of that pious Lady?</p>
            <p>If the monaſtery of <hi>Seins</hi> in <hi>Burro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure</hi> nigh <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were ſtanding, it would tell you 'twas hither ſhe retired her ſelf after the deceaſe of her Lord; to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in ſolitude with more freedom to God. I am now defac'd, ſhe is Dead, who having chiefly founded me; while ſhe lived, conſerved me, and decored me.</p>
            <p>SIR, can you forget, or not reſpect the memory of ſo much piety? To which
<pb facs="tcp:44999:6"/>
they were powerfully moved by the belief they had of the adorable Sacrifice of the Altar. As often as you ſee the three Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents in your Arms, remember that you muſt increaſe or grow as they did in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely Faith of this Myſtery, which is the ſeed of Divine Love and Charity to your Neighbour. I know you have hazarded ſomething already for your Faith, but if an other occaſion be given you, mindful of one of the Noble Motto's of your Houſe, <hi>hazard yet further,</hi> in what is prudently acknowledged to be the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, there is no danger to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douted, or ſo much as apprehended. Your very name SET-ON minds you of generoſity in what you act for God, or may undertake for the Service of his Vice-gerent upon Earth, the King.</p>
            <p>God and you know beſt what hope you have lay'd up in Heaven, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5, But much of Your Charitie the World has ſeen. I am the Subject of a notable part of it, and Witneſs of your ſheltring poor Strangers, conſidering diſtreſſed Tenents, clothing

Such actions done in the Spirit of Chriſt, make ſavour at preſent in the Euchariſt, the ſweetneſs of the hidden Manna there, and will Crown hereafter the Chriſtian in the ſolemn day of the general Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>NO wonder our Ghoſtly Enemy is ſo earnest to perſwade men that there is no true Sacrifice in the <hi>Maſs.</hi> He knows that it is the very Center of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, the Arcenall of armes against him, the Store-houſe of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the great means the Church has to pacifie God in his Wrath, and draw down from Heaven bleſſings upon her Children. He knows it is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent ſucceeding Sacrifice to all the Sacrifices of the Old Law; a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit holocauſt, in which <hi>JESUS</hi> is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally conſumed in the fire of his Love, in acknowledgment of the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
<pb facs="tcp:44999:8"/>
of his Father; An Euchariſtical, becauſe in thanksgiving for the daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits we receive from above we can offer nothing more pleaſing; A Sacrifice of Satisfaction, becauſe the hatred, which God carries to the ſins of the World, is not ſo great, as the Love he bears to his Son, whoſe merits far exceed the enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our offences; A Sacrifice of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration, becauſe the Father cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe any thing to a Son who in all his life and death upon Earth, has ſo highly obliged him. Wherefore the Preiſt, tho in contemplation of his own ſinful condition, is always bound to ſay, <hi>O Lord, I am not worthy;</hi> yet having at the Altar Chriſt in his hands, he may alſo ſay with an humble confidence <hi>Reſpice in faciem Chriſti tui;</hi> Eternal Father; tho' I am not worthy to petition either for my ſelf or others, yet be pleaſed to grant us what we in humility demand for the Love of him, who vouchſafed to dye for the Love of us, ſince as our offering is the offering of Chriſt, ſo our request is his, and he ordained us to mind thus Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
<pb facs="tcp:44999:8"/>
by this commemoration of his Death.</p>
            <p>The Son of God finding his Father not content withall the oblations which pure men could offer him for their ſins, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificium &amp; oblationem noluiſti.

Hebr. 10. v. 5, 6, 7.</hi> Out of his Love to men reſolved to be both our Preiſt <hi>&amp; Victime, a Body thou haſt fited to me, behold I come.</hi> So ſacrificing himſelf in a bloody way upon mount <hi>Calvarie,</hi> he laid into the Treaſury of the Church an inexhauſtable ranſom for all mankind; having provided before by the Sacrifice he made at the laſt Supper (commanding his Diſciples to offer in like manner in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him) for our daily neceſſity of a daily Sacrifice, (daily Sacrifice of a Lamb commanded, <hi>Exo. 29.38.</hi>) daily to acknowledge God's ſupream being; to give him daily thanks for his daily benefits; and to obtain new helps in our daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; where he inſtituted his Body
<pb facs="tcp:44999:9"/>
and Blood to be offered daily under the Forms of Bread and Wine, according to the Order of <hi>Melchiſedech;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>(hoc facite, do this.

            <p>To prove this truth efficaciouſly as I undertake by the help of God to do in this Book, in which I anſwer Chapter for Chapter <hi>Monſieur Rodon</hi>'s funeral of the <hi>Maſs.</hi>

            <p>I prove firſt of all the <hi>Catholick</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, both for the Reality of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Euchariſt, with other Doctrines relating to it; and that in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> or <hi>Maſs</hi> is made a true and proper Sacrifice, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in their proper place) by proofs, which either did not come into <hi>Monſieur Rodon</hi>'s mind, or if they did, he thought good to take no notice of them. Next I ſolve his objections, ſome of which, if the <hi>Catholick</hi> Reader find ſet out by me in a more convincing way then by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur

            <p>Moreover let the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be pleaſed to reflect that <hi>Mr. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s arguments are drawn from our ſenſes, which are plauſible to men of Fleſh and Blood, whereas many of our anſwers in this Mysterie of Faith, are drawn from Faith, or Reaſons grounded upon Faith, which are above the reach of Fleſh and Blood, and muſt mount to a higher ſtory than that of our ſenſes, to be applauded. <hi>Math. 16. v. 17.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning the expoſition of theſe words,</hi> THIS IS MY BODIE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE ſay theſe words <hi>This is my Body</hi> prove clearly the real preſence of Chriſts Body in the Hoſt. Becauſe they ought to be taken in their proper ſenſe, in which they would prove it clearly by the grant of our adverſaries, who therfore ſay, they are to be taken figuratively. Now that they ought to be taken here in their proper ſenſe I prove 1. poſitively.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECTION I. <hi>Poſitive Proofs.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. WHen in a ſpeach a word is indifferent of it ſelf, to be taken in the literal or figurative ſenſe, you muſt look to the words that follow in the ſame ſpeach: if they expreſs the propertie of a figure, the word is to be taken
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44999:11"/>
figuratively; if the propertie of the real thing, then the word is to be taken in the literal ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>For example, when one tells me <hi>I have ſeen the King,</hi> I know not yet what he means; whether his perſon or picture; but when he adds, <hi>ſet in a frame of Gold,</hi> I know he means his picture, becauſe 'tis the propertie of a picture to be ſet in a frame. If he adds, <hi>ſpeaking with the Chancellor,</hi> I know he means the King's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe 'tis the propertie of a perſon to ſpeake with another. Juſt ſo when Chriſt ſayes <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>This is my Bodie:</hi> I know not yet what he means, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Real Body, or only a figure of it. But when he adds, <hi>which is given for you,</hi> I know he means of his true Body, becauſe 'tis the propertie of a true Bodie to be ſacrificed for us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I prove again that theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are to be taken in the literal ſenſe, by the proteſtant principle, which is this. When two paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges relate to, or ſpeak of the ſame matter in Scripture, the obſcurer paſſage is to be explaned by the clearer.</p>
                  <p>But theſe two paſſages relating to our Lord's Supper <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> This latter is the obſcurer, and that former the clearer; then this latter ought to be explaned by that former, that is to ſay, to the ſenſe of that former <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt having changed a piece of Bread into his Body by his almightie word, ſayes there to his diſciples <hi>Do ye for the food of others ſouls, what ye have ſeen me do for the food of yours:</hi> Change ye lykewayes, by pronouncing the words I have ordained for that end, Bread into my Body: but do it with ſuch circumſtances that people ſtanding by may be mindful of my death and paſſion.</p>
                  <p>But the clear propoſition ought not to be explaned by the obſcure one, thus: <hi>This is my Body,</hi> that is to ſay, this is a figure only or a remembrance of my body, becauſe he ſaid after <hi>do this in remembrance of me;</hi> for the thing was now done, and he had told them what it was in clear words afore he ſaid <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44999:11"/>
of me;</hi> He did not ſay, <hi>this is a remembrance of me,</hi> no, but <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> He did not ſpeake of the ſubſtance of the thing but only of the manner of doing it. By theſe words then <hi>in remembrance of me,</hi> he only intimated, that they ſhould make at that ſame time a ſenſible expreſſion of his paſſion to the people, as is ſeen done in the ſacrifice of the Maſſe. If by, <hi>This,</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a figure or remembrance, then he had ſaid, do or make a remembrance of me in remembrance of me, or remember me to remember me, which is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
                  <p>Now, let any indifferent and judicious man be judge, if theſe words <hi>do this in remembrance of me,</hi> be as clear to prove, that in the Euchariſt or the Lord's Supper is only a Figure of Chriſt's Bodie; as theſe words <hi>This is my Bodie,</hi> are clear to prove, that the Euchariſt is his true Body.</p>
                  <p>If you inſtance, that as Chriſt ſaid <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſo he ſaid alſo <hi>I am a vine,</hi> and conſequently as the latter propoſition muſt be taken figuratively, ſo muſt alſo the former. <hi>I anſwer</hi> it doth not follow, there being a great diſparity. For we all, proteſtants as well as Catholicks, avow that propoſitions in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be taken in the literal ſenſe, if ſo taken they imply or intimate ſomething contrarie to faith, as this propoſition <hi>I am a vine</hi> literallie taken would do. For proteſtants as well as Catholicks believe that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine word</hi> hath aſſumed no nature but that of man; then he hath not aſſumed that of a Vine, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently 'tis againſt faith to ſay in the literal ſenſe <hi>Chriſt is a Vine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe words <hi>This is my Body</hi> taken in the literal ſenſe imply nothing againſt faith; no more then he, who ſhewing you a knife, ſayes <hi>This is a knife;</hi> for the terme <hi>This</hi> and the terme <hi>Knife</hi> ſuppoſe for the ſame thing, and not for different natures; ſo in Chriſt's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>This is my Bodie, This,</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> ſuppoſe for the ſame thing, not <hi>This</hi> for <hi>Bread,</hi> but for <hi>The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44999:12"/>
Body of Chriſt;</hi> as well as the word <hi>Bodie</hi> ſuppoſes for it, tho in a different way of ſignifieing, <hi>This</hi> obſcurely and <hi>Body</hi> clearly and diſtinctlie.</p>
                  <p>Here I humbly intreat the proteſtant reader to reflect, that in the myſteries of Religion we muſt captivate our underſtanding 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 5. (that is to ſay; ſuſpend it from aſſerting what it might judge, had it nothing to rely upon, but the ſole relation of our ſenſes) to obey Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>God will have, as an homage due to him and his veracitie, this proud faculty of man, which is earneſt to judge of all, ſubmit to his word. The aſſent of my underſtanding by which I judge a thing to be, becauſe I ſee it with my eyes, is an aſſent of ſcience, which is a knowledge quite different from the aſſent of faith. In the mean time we Chriſtians, as Chriſtians are called, not philoſophers the Reaſoners, but the faithfull. <hi>fides eſt,</hi> as we ſay, <hi>credere quod non vides, Faith is to believe that which thou doeſt not ſee. This is the praiſe of faith,</hi> ſayeth St. Aug. tract. 29. in Io. <hi>If that, which is believed, be not ſeen. Bleſſed are they, ſaid Chriſt Io.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>who have not ſeen and have beleived. Faith is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (or perſwaſion) ſaith S. Paul, of things not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi> If they appear, and I aſſent that they are becauſe I ſee them, my faith ceaſes, Science coming in with faith's deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay I beleive that the Son of God became Man, becauſe God hath revealed it, and my ſenſes do not controll it: your faith is lame, not able to ſtand alone, and conſequentlie is an unworthie ſacrifice of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the word of God.</p>
                  <p>What would the King ſay to that Noble man, who ſhould diſtruſt his relation made in preſence of all his courtiers, of a thing done by his Majeſtie upon his Royal word; who ſhould, (I ſay), diſtruſt it, becauſe he heard it controlled by a foot-boy or ſome ſuch mean perſon of as little credit?</p>
                  <p>As humane faith requires I rely upon the ſole teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44999:12"/>
of a man, ſo does divine faith require I rely upon the ſole teſtimonie of God. ſhall I truſt the word of a man ſomtimes contrarie to ſenſible appearance, as when I truſt upon the word of a Doctor or a Surgeon that that which I feele hurts me, will do me good, and ſhall not I truſt the word of God becauſe my ſenſes ſeem to control it?</p>
                  <p>But be not miſtaken, neither ſenſe nor reaſon controles the real preſence of Chriſts Bodie in the Euchariſt. For, ſenſe after the conſecration finds its whole object, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, taſte &amp;c. Juſt as before the conſecration unchanged, and meddles not to judge whether the Body of Chriſt or the ſubſtance of bread be under the accidents, as a thing belonging to the underſtanding, and not within the compaſs of its object. And reaſon tels us that altho all the accidents of a ſubſtance be preſent, nevertheleſs their ſubſtance is not there, if the author of nature has revealed that he hinders its preſence to them; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does not controle our ſaying that the ſubſtance of Bread is not in the Euchariſt after the conſecration, becauſe the author of Nature hath revealed the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. No more then it controles Proteſtants ſaying that thoſe three, who appeared to <hi>Abraham Geneſ.</hi> 18 with all the accidents of men, were not men but Angells, becauſe God has revealed it was ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt by his almightie power could change Bread into his fleſh, and he tells us <hi>Math.</hi> 26. in theſe words <hi>This is my Bodie,</hi> that he hath done it; why ſhall not I believe it? O but it ſeemes ſtrange to our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! muſt God then in that thing in which he will make to all men a memoriall of his wonders <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>v.</hi> 4. do nothing but what is within the reach of meaner wits, and falls under their ſenſes? this clame is too proud there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in humilitie, which gives light I anſwer, (which is a negative way of proving) <hi>Monſieur de Rhodon's</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>

                     </gap>ove infinitely exceeding the common uſage of the world, why might there not be ſomthing extraordinary in the way of expreſſion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 2. Speaking ſo, he ſpoke not contrarie to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the world in practical or factive propoſitions which make their objects. Such as theſe are <hi>This is my Body, Math,</hi> 26. <hi>Let there be light. Geneſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Thy Son lives. Io.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 50 <hi>This ring is yours.</hi> The firſt turnes Bread into Fleſh. The ſecond changes Darkneſs into light. The third the noble-man's Son's ſickneſs into health The fourth makes the Ring which was not yours, yours, to wit, when I gift a perſon with a Ring in thoſe words.</p>
                  <p>Reflect then well upon the difference between a purely Enunciative and a practicall propoſition, that preſuppoſes the whole exiſtence of its object; this does not preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, but makes it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Ro.</hi> Urges. Wordes are Images of Conceptions and Conceptions the Images of Things. Therefore things muſt be ſuch before we can conceive them to be ſuch, or ſay, they are ſuch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſwer,</hi> diſt. the conſequent. Things muſt be alwayes actually a fore words and conceptions, which are Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of them, I deny, for my idea of a thing, which I invent, ſuppoſes the thing never to have been, and by this idea of it I am moved to try to make it and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44999:13"/>
give it a being. Things muſt be poſſible before we can conceive them, I grant. Alſo the thing which is made by words as the object of factive propoſitions can not be actually before the words, becauſe an effect can not be before its cauſe. And conſequently that which our Saviour gave his diſcipels, ſaying <hi>This</hi> &amp;c. was not there before theſe words <hi>This is my Body</hi> were pronounced; becauſe it was made to be there by them. <hi>Neot,</hi> In a factive propoſition a thing muſt not be ſuch the whole time the propoſition is pronuncing, as it will be at the end of the propoſition, becauſe the whole propoſition maks it and gives it its being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Ro.</hi> Urges farther. A propoſition muſt be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to the nature of the thing in queſtion: but when Chriſt taking bread in his hand ſaid <hi>This is my Body,</hi> the thing in queſtion was bread: therefore the propoſition ought to be expounded according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bread, the nature of which is to be, not the real bodie, but only the figure of the Body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the minor propoſition, that the thing in queſtion was bread, and ſay that the thing in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was that which Chriſt meant by <hi>This,</hi> and that which he meant by <hi>this</hi> was that which he intended to make by his whole propoſition, which was his true body; as we gather out of the following words <hi>Which is given for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's another thing when a man in a painters ſhop poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Kings picture, ſayes this is the King; the thing in queſtion there or ſignyfied and meant by <hi>This,</hi> is the picture, becauſe we know he cannot mean otherwiſe, unleſs he were diſtracted, his words not being of power to change the picture into the King's perſon, as the almighty words of Chriſt were of power to change bread into his body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> the article, <hi>This,</hi> alone ſignifies nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, becauſe to ſignifie preſent, paſt, or to come is the property of Verbs. So when I pointing to a book ſay, <hi>This is,</hi> you know not yet what I mean, till I ſay
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44999:14"/>
                     <hi>Engliſh; Good paper, a wittie book.</hi> Alſo when Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, Jo. 15. v. 11. <hi>This is my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> they knew not what he meant, till he added, <hi>That you love one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore <hi>This</hi> in Chriſts propoſition, before he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>is my Body,</hi> ſignifying nothing preſent, did not ſignifie the Bread which was then in his hand: but joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the reſt of the propoſition ſignified his true Body.</p>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. The Euchariſt is the Sacrament of Chriſt's Body, then it is not his true Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſwer</hi> 1. diſt. the antecedent. The Euchariſt is the Sacrament of Chriſt's Body <hi>Intranſitively, i. e,</hi> without paſſing from the Sacrament to the Body of Chriſt as to a different thing, or ſo that the Sacrament and Chriſt's Body be one and the ſame ſubſtance, I grant. <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, i. e.</hi> paſſing, and ſo making them two divers ſubſtances, I deny the antecedent. The Euchariſt then is the Sacrament of Chriſt's Body, <hi>i. e,</hi> the Sacrament which is Chriſt's Body: or Chriſt's body under the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form or accidents of Bread is a Sacrament, or a ſenſible ſign by the <hi>Species</hi> of Grace, which it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k's in us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 2. The Euchariſt taken inadequately, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially for the <hi>Species,</hi> is a Sacrament or ſign of Chriſt's Body, the Conſecration being made, I grant. <hi>Adequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telie</hi> and Totally taken for the whole Euchariſt, I deny. For ſo it includes both Chriſt's body, and the <hi>Species,</hi> afore of Bread, now of his Body.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Euchariſt may be called a figure or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from one another, a repreſentation of Chriſt's death; The <hi>Species</hi> of Bread alone (the conſecration being made) a figure of the Body contained under it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note.</hi> An Image, ſign or Sacrament may have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it the ſubſtance or eſſence of the thing by it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or repreſented in another manner. God the ſon is the Image of his father, and has his father's ſubſtance,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44999:14"/>
yea the father all within him by circuminceſſion, i. e, a mutuall being of the divine perſones in each other. So Chriſt's fleſh inviſible and ſpirituall in the Euchariſt, is the ſacrament or ſign of the ſame fleſh palpable and viſible crucified. In the Sacrament it repreſents it ſelf as on the Croſs, not different in ſubſtance, but in qualitie and manner. As when God 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 9. is ſaid to have given to <hi>Saul</hi> another heart, <hi>viz.</hi> in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie not in ſubſtance: So it's ſaid 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 50. <hi>Fleſh and blood ſhall not poſſeſſe the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and again it's certain fleſh and blood ſhall poſſeſs the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> When it has put on Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſame in ſubſtance in both propoſitions, but not the ſame in qualitie.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 3. In theſe two propoſitions <hi>This is my Bodie. This Cup is the new teſtament in my Blood.</hi> The word, <hi>is,</hi> muſt be taken in the ſame ſenſe, becauſe they are alyke having been pronunced on the ſame matter <hi>viz.</hi> the one upon the one part of the Sacrament and the other on the other part of it, and becauſe of like things we give alike iudgement. But in this propoſition <hi>This Cup is the new Teſtament,</hi> the word <hi>is,</hi> is not taken for a reall and tranſubſtantiated being, but for a Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and ſignificative being &amp;c Therfore in this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lykwayes <hi>This is my Bodie,</hi> the word, <hi>is,</hi> is not taken for a reall and tranſubſtantiated being, but for a Sacramentall and ſignificative being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If the two propoſitions be ſet down as S. <hi>Math.</hi> (who was preſent and heard them out of the mouth of Chriſt) relates them <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 22. and <hi>v.</hi> 24 <hi>This is my Bodie. This is my Blood,</hi> granting the <hi>Major</hi> I deny the <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition.</p>
                  <p>If the one as <hi>S Mathew</hi> ſets it down, and the other as S. <hi>Paul</hi> who was not preſent, and ſets only down the ſenſe of Chriſt's words in a figurative way: I let paſs the <hi>Minor,</hi> and deney the <hi>conſequence,</hi> becauſe the two propoſitions ſo taken are not alike as to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and I ſay that the H. Ghoſt might have had a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44999:15"/>
particular reaſon to move <hi>S. Paul</hi> to rehearſe the ſenſe of what had been related by <hi>S. Mathew This is my Blood,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>This is the new teſtament in my Blood</hi> to give us another ſenſible impreſſion of the myſterie <hi>viz. This Cup is the new teſtament in my Blood,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, This cup is an authentick inſtrument, or, as it were paper, in which my new teſtament and laſt will of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you eternal life, if you believe and obey me, is written, not with Ink, but with my oun Blood, which this Cup contains, as the Paper the writing of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So <hi>Alapide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in this propoſition the word, <hi>is,</hi> cannot be taken in the proper ſenſe of the words as in the other <hi>This is my Body,</hi> becauſe there would follow an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, <hi>viz.</hi> a real Identity between the Cup, or what is contained in it, and the teſtament ſignifying or the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expr ſion of his will, which is abſurd and evidentlie falſe. And in that ſenſe above I let paſſe the <hi>Minor,</hi> for if by <hi>Teſtament</hi> you underſtand the Teſtament ſignified, not the Teſtament ſignifying, the word <hi>is</hi> may be, and is taken for a real and tranſubſtantiated being, becauſe the Blood contained in the Cup is that which he left by his laſt will to the faithfull. So, that, which is in the Cup is changed into a Teſtament, being by the whole propoſition as the cauſe, tranſubſtantiated into the Blood of Chriſt, and conſequently this propoſition <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament,</hi> muſt not be expounded thus, the wine that is in the Cup is the ſing and Sacrament of of the new Teſtament, but thus: The conſecrated wine that is in the Cup is the real Blood of Chriſt and new Teſtament. That he made then his new Teſtament I ſhall prove in my 8 <hi>Chap.</hi> When I ſay that all that Chriſt ſaid, when he inſtituted the Euchariſt muſt be taken li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terallie and without a figure, I mean as the inſtitution of the Euchariſt is related to us by S. <hi>Mathew</hi> who was preſent at it, and heard the words out of the mouth of Chriſt in the verie inſtitution it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Since <hi>Mr Rodon</hi> contends ſo much for the figurative
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44999:15"/>
ſenſe of the words in the Conſecration, I avow that in the conſec ation as related by <hi>S. Luke</hi> in theſe words <hi>Touto to potéèr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Cup is the new teſtament in my Blood, which is ſhed for you.</hi> The word <hi>Cup</hi> is taken figurativelie for the thing contained in it; becauſe from it taken in the proper ſenſe would follow an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cup it ſelf wood or mettal was ſhed for us, becauſe the Relative <hi>Which</hi> and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <hi>Shed</hi> is referred by <hi>S. Luke.</hi> to <hi>Cup</hi> (as he who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands Greek ſees in the forementioned words) not properly taken, then Metaphorically or Figurativelie tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for the thing contained in the Cup, or Blood of Chriſt which is ſaid to be ſhed for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. When a man ſaith a thing is ſuch, if it be not ſuch during the whole time, which he employes in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſuch he makes a falſe propoſition, then Chriſt according to Romaniſts made a falſe propoſition, when he ſaid <hi>This is my Body</hi> becauſe his Body was not under the forme of Bread the whole time he was pronouncing the propoſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I diſt: the antecedent. If the propoſition be purely Enunciative or ſpeculative, its true, becauſe ſuch a propoſition preſuppoſes its object; If it be a fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive or practical propoſition ſuch as the propoſition of Chriſt in the inſtitution of the Euchariſt was, it's falſe; becauſe a factive propoſition makes it's object and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſuppoſes it not to be afore the whole propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is utered, which whole propoſition taken all togither, and not anie part of it taken alone, cauſes the object.</p>
                  <p>I end this chapter with two reflections. The firſt, That <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi> and other proteſtants to impoſe upon men their word for the word of God uſe violence to the words of Chriſt; when they explaine theſe his words <hi>This is my Body,</hi> thus: <hi>This Bread ſignifies my Body,</hi> or thus: <hi>This Bread is a ſign of my Bodie;</hi> eſpeciallie ſince Chriſt prevented all ſuch interpretations by his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>Which is given for you Luke.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 19.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44999:16"/>
This is my blood <hi>Which is ſhed for you.</hi> Was Bread ſacrificed for us? or wine ſhed for us?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond. Since God ſpeaking by the ſcripture is their only judge of Controverſie, why will not they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his words in their proper ſignification? How ſhall a judge do the dutie of a judge, if he give his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence darkly and enigmatically, ſo that the two parties go ſtill by the ears after they have heard his ſentence, neither they, nor anie other who was preſent ſeing clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in whoſe favour he hath given it.</p>

                     <hi>Rem.</hi> 4. here, That this eating is different from that meer ſpiritual eating of which he ſpoke in the beginning of the Chapter, when he aimed onlie to make them firſt believe that he was the ſon of God. That he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at that preſent time, and therefore checked them then for not believing. This he required only after he had given them his fleſh to eat, which he then promiſed, and performed only a year after, to wit when he inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Sacriment, and after gave it to his Diſciples. for we cannot eate a thing afore we get it to eate, and Chriſt did not ſay then. <hi>v.</hi> 52. The bread which <hi>I give</hi> but which <hi>I will give</hi> is my fleſh. Which, as I ſaid, he performed only at the nixt paſſover or Eaſter. Hence gather that that eating was a Sacramental or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible eating by the mouth of the Body, and not a meer ſpiritual eating by the mouth of Faith. Which he exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>v.</hi> 36. and which ſome had performed alreadie.</p>

                  <p>We ſay that theſe latter paſſages are the obſcurer, and do not prove ſo clearly that we muſt eate and drink the Body and Blood of Chriſt only by faith: as ours prove that wee muſt eate the Body and drink the Blood of Chriſt by the mouth of the Body. 1. Becauſe theſe two paſſages do not ſpeak of faith, but only of ſpirit and life, there are other acts of ſpirit and life than acts of faith, the acts of love <hi>&amp;. The zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me.</hi> ſayes <hi>David. Pſal.</hi> 69. <hi>v.</hi> .9 in the proteſtant Bible, in ours 68. <hi>v.</hi> 10. How prove you that Chriſt means here an act of faith? 2.

Chriſt ſayes <hi>unleſs you eate the f eſh and drink the blood of the ſon of man</hi> &amp;c. We underſtand he means with the mouth of the body.</p>
                  <p>Again ſince to eate and drink are the proper acts of the mouth, till you prove to us that we cannot receave the body of Chriſt ſpiritualiſed or having the property of a ſpirit, into our mouths, why ſhall not wee believe that Chriſt meant we ſhould eate his fleſh with the mouth of our Body, ſince a terme <hi>ſine addito,</hi> if you add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is alwiſe taken for the thing for which it ſuppoſes properlie. So <hi>Homo a man,</hi> if you add nothing ſuppoſes for a true man, and not a painted man wherefore Chriſt ſaying <hi>Unleſs you eate the body of the ſon of man,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding, <hi>by faith,</hi> that eateing he ſpeaks of, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtood by the mouth of the body, this being that which we underſtand properly by the tearm <hi>eating.</hi> Nor doth its not nouriſhing the body hinder it to be eaten by the mouth of the body, no more then poyſon, tho it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh not, hinders to believe that many have drunk poiſon Since then theſe two latter paſſages are the obſcurer, they ought to be explained to the ſenſe of the former two paſſages brought by us, or ſo that they do not contradict them, which are clear.

                     <hi>'Tis the ſpirit that quickneſs</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e,</hi> 'Tis my divine ſpirit or my Divinity that quicknes the receaver of my Body to a ſupernatural life, as the ſoul quicknes the body to actiones of a natural life; and as the bodie could not be quickned to hear or ſee without the ſoul ſo could not the receaver of my Bodie or he who eates it ſacramentallie be quickned to a ſupernatural life were it not united to my divinity. Of which divine ſpirit quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or giving life, to wit, ſupernatural, the words I have ſpoken are to be underſtood. 2. <hi>My words are ſpirit and life.</hi> i. e. They are to be underſtood ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or that you are to eate my fleſh being in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after a ſpiritual way with the propertie of a ſpirit for the nouriſhment of your ſoul; not being there in a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44999:19"/>
carnall way like a piece of dead fleſh to be divided with your teeth for the nouriſhment of your body. 3. <hi>My words are ſpirit and life. i. e.</hi> My words intimated <hi>v.</hi> 54. <hi>Unleſs you eate the fleſh of the ſon of man.</hi> &amp;c Obeyed will give you my ſpirit and by it a ſupernatural life, or grace which leads to eternall life. Chriſt adds preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>v.</hi> 65, There are ſome of you which do not <hi>believe,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay the reaſon wherefore you ſtumble at my promiſe of giving you my fleſh to eate is becauſe you do not believe really that I am the ſon of God, and ſo able to do all things howſoever ſtrange they may ſeem to be.</p>
                  <p>By what I have ſaid in this ſection you ſee proven that theſe words of Chriſt <hi>He that eates my fleſh and drinks my blood hath eternall life. Io.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 55. and, <hi>my fleſh is meat indeed &amp;c. v.</hi> 56. are to be underſtood of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eating by the mouth of the body and not of a meer ſpiritual eating and drinking by faith.</p>
                  <p>I ſay not a meer ſpiritual eating, becauſe we hold we muſt add an act of faith to our ſenſible, eating of his Body, nay this Corporall eating may be cald a ſpiritual eating in a good ſenſe, in as much as we believe That the Bodie of Chriſt in the ſacrament as it is reallie there, ſo it is ſpiritualiy, I mean with the propertie of a ſpirit. As <hi>S. Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 44. ſayes, Our bodies ſhall riſe ſpiritual, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſpiritualized- <hi>viz.</hi> in glory they ſhall have the properties of a ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Note, as Heat is cal'd the propertie of Fire becauſe the nature of Fire has a clame to Heat and an exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce or a natural appetite of it, tho actual Heat (not the exigence or natural apetite of it) might be given to water; ſo to be all in all and all in every part of an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place is called the propertie of a ſpirit, becauſe the nature of a ſpirit has an exigence of it, tho this way of exiſting (not the exigence of it) may by the almighty power of God be communicated to a body. If then a glorious body has this property of a ſpirit to enter through a wall without making a breach, why may not the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44999:19"/>
whole body of Chriſt be in the whole, and leaſt part of the hoſt? So our way of eating him there is conform to his way of being there, which is ſpiritual with the propertie of a ſpirit, his whole Body being in the leaſt particle of the hoſt: not carnal as if we divided his body with our teeth. Spiritual again in as much as we believe That his real Bodie ſo receaved in that ſpiritual manner as he commands under the accidents of bread by the mouth of the Body, feeds the ſoul or ſpirit by the grace it produces there. And this eating of Chriſt's Body and drinking his Blood that way ſatiſfies the hunger and thirſt we had of his grace.</p>
                  <p>Another proof that Chriſt meant the real manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his true Body when he ſaid Take eate <hi>&amp;c. For this is my Body, is,</hi> what he ſaid to the Iews. <hi>Io.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 51. <hi>The Bread which I will give you. (is), viz.</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>my Fleſh.</hi> Where I remark the word, <hi>is,</hi> the ſacrament not being yet made, could not import <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies my fleſh;</hi> but becauſe the Bread, only as a ſacrament could ſignifie his fleſh) imports an identitie or ſamety of that bread, he ſpoke of, with his fleſh. Hence the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he made after, and which we now receive under the form of Bread being that bread he promiſed to give, it follows that it is his real Fleſh, and therefore our eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is a real and corporal manducation of his Body,</p>
                  <p>Add to all I have ſaid, that Chriſt's fleſh is not meat really and indeed to him who believs only, no more then the King's picture is to him that ſees it, the King indeed or truely the King. For things that are ſaid to be ſuch <hi>indeed</hi> according to our common way of ſpeaking are underſtood to be ſuch properly and not figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely.</p>

                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. Chriſt ſayes <hi>Io,</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 35. He that comes to me (to wit by faith) ſhall never hunger, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in me ſhall never thirſt. Then the eating of Chriſt's fleſh is ſpiritual by Faith and not corporal.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer denying the conſequence. And ſay that who believes in Chriſt ſhall neither hunger nor thirſt, becauſe to the believer Chriſt will give his Body and Blood to be eaten and drunken corporally which will ſatiſfie the Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's hunger and thirſt of him, and more over hinder in him the hunger and thirſt of periſhing things. 'Tis not then a bare believing, which is only a beginning and diſpoſition to the ſatiſfying of the hunger and thirſt of the ſoul, but the worthy eating the body and blood of Chriſt which gives that ſatiſfaction <hi>Who eates my fleſh and drinks my blood remains</hi> in me and I in him. <hi>Io.</hi> 6 <hi>v.</hi> 57.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the cenſequence and ſay that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the reprobate receiving the Blood of Chriſt by the mouth of the Body has not eternal life, is becauſe he preſumes to receive it being in mortal ſin, and ſo eates and drinks unworthily, and conſequently eates and drinks his damnation according to <hi>S. Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>And here I remark that according to proteſtants Chriſt's body
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44999:20"/>
cannot be eaten <hi>unworthily.</hi> For according to Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> in this chapter, and other proteſtants Chriſt's bodie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eaten but by faith (<hi>viz.</hi> a ſaving fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. <hi>S. Aug.</hi> does not ſay ſimply To eate the Fleſh of Chriſt is a figure but bringing the words of Chriſt <hi>Io.</hi> 6. Unleſs you eate my fleſh <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſays, Chriſt ſeems to command a wicked act or hainous offenſe, <hi>Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ergò</hi> it is then a figure. I ſubſume, but Chriſt does not ſeeme to Ro: Catholicks, who believe he ſpesaks in that place only of a ſacramental manducation, to command there a heinous offenſe, then according to <hi>S. Auſtin.</hi> we have no need to take his words figuratively. But for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharnaites, to whom he ſeems to command a heinous offenſe, they ought to take them figuratively, that they may not cenſure him. To underſtand then this paſſage in the apprehenſion of the Capharnaites; you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that as we are wont to kill thoſe beaſts, whoſe fleſh we eate, afore we eate them: So the Jews out of Chriſt's words had apprehended that they ought firſt to kill Chriſt, and after to eate his fleſh cut in pieces boiled or reſted.</p>
                  <p>This without doubt was a wicked or heinous offenſe. He means then ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> a figure of his death, not his true death, and that they ought not to kill Chriſt truly, but by taking the ſacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt repreſent his ſlaughter, and by their manners expreſs his death, that they ought not to kill Chriſt but to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 2. We heartily acknowledge that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt and the Preiſt's eating of it, is a figure or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the paſſion of Chriſt, Teaching us (continues <hi>S. Auſtin) viz.</hi> preiſt's, ſuch as he was, <hi>to partake of Chriſt's paſſion,</hi> to wit, when it repreſents it to them by their eating the Bodie under the form of Bread ſeparate from the ſpecies of Wine, and after drinking the Blood under the ſpecies of Wine which was conſecrated ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the ſpecies of Bread; <hi>And to imprint,</hi> adds <hi>S. Aug, in our memories with delight and profit that Chriſt was crucified for us.</hi> For can it be but delightful to a man to think of his ſalvation purchaſed to him by the death of Chriſt, if he pleaſes, and profitable to encourage him to live a good life in order to make it ſure?</p>
                  <p>Having anſwered this objection by which he would have <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> ſeem to deny the real preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt Let me bring him a paſſage from the ſame <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> by which he clearly aſſerts it.</p>

but we find it in Chriſt.</q> For Chriſt was carried in his own hands when commending that ſame Bodie of his, he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> for he did cary that Body in his own hands.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Be pleaſed now to reflect out of theſe paſſages. 1. That Judas his eating <hi>our price,</hi> to wit, Chriſt, was a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eating by the mouth, of the Body for he did not eat him by faith. 2, That our receiving our mediator with faithful heart and <hi>mouth,</hi> as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, cannot ſtand, if we exclude our corporal eating Chriſt's Body in that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner I explained in the ſecond ſection of this Chapter.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer that 'tis faith in Chriſt's death that makes us eate the fleſh and drink the blood of Chriſt, ſo that if I ceaſe to fulfil this his commandement of eating his fleſh and drink<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44999:22"/>
his blood I ſhew I have no faith in his death without which there is no life of the ſpirit. Moreover when we eate the Body and drink the Blood of Chriſt we ought, not flightly to reflect, but as we chew our meat and let down our drink by little and little, ruminate, and conſider ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely the death of Chriſt repreſented to us in our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſaeth not, ſays the Cardinal, he that eates wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily or drinks worthily, hath, to wit, eternal life, but he that eates and drinks. Hence <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi> infers this eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking is to be underſtood not of the ſacrament but of an eating and drinking, <hi>viz.</hi> by faith, the death of Chriſt.</p>

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Tho Chriſt did not ſay, who eates or drinkes <hi>worthily,</hi> he meant ſo, as may be gathered from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>hath eternal life,</hi> for none, I ſuppoſe, will aſcribe eternal life to an unworthy eating as to its cauſe and condition. But how does <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi> from eates or drinks ſolitarily put, without <hi>by the mouth of the body or by the mouth of faith,</hi> gather that the Cardinal, and Chriſt before him meant of an eating by ſaith or an eating of the death of Chriſt, ſince when we hear mention of eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king without any addition, we preſently underſtand by the mouth of the body. as when we hear named a man, we underſtand a rational ſenſible creature, not a painted man or that which improperly is called a man.</p>

The action wherby Jeſus Chriſt is applied to us for Righteouſnes and ſanctification is nothing elſe but faith, therefore the ſpiritual eateing and drinking by faith and not the corporal by the mouth. is the action whereby we have that life which <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt has purchaſed to us by his death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the Antecedent, and ſay we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo partially by good works Iac. 2.

Was not St. <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> juſtified when her ſins were pardoned her, <hi>becauſe ſhe loved much.</hi> And is not her love here alleadged by Chriſt for the cauſe of her juſtification? I do not deny but that ſhe had faith alſo as a diſpoſition to the ſame juſtification.</p>

                  <p>Moreover I ſay that Chriſt's Fleſh broken, and his blood ſhed on the Croſſe was not ſpiritual food <hi>indeed,</hi> becauſe they were never to coëxiſt actually with our ſpiritual feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Chriſt's fleſh in the Euchariſt does, and therefore is meat <hi>indeed.</hi> The food, to be food <hi>indeed</hi> to one, and the feeding muſt be joined together, but when we now believe Chriſt's death, it is not preſent, but paſt, and therefore is not food to the believer; but when we believe and take by the mouth of our Body Chriſt's fleſh, it is there joyned with our ſpiritual eating, producing Grace, ſtrenghtning and encreaſing our ſpiritual life, and therefore is meat indeed.</p>

What if the Sabellians not conceiving how the Paternity ſhould not be communicated to God the Son as well as the Divine Eſſence, ſince the Paternitie and the Divine Eſſence are one and the ſame thing, ſhould have ſaid it's a more ſuitable and rational ſenſe of paſſages which ſeeme in ſcripture to ſay there are three diſtinct perſons in the Divine nature, that there is only one perſone having three different functions, called Father as he creats, Son as he redeems, and Holy Ghoſt as he ſanctifies.

                  <p>IS it not prettie to hear <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi> with ſome other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſpeak of one of the darkeſt myſteries of our faith as of a natural thing, and when their weak reaſon looking only to nature cannot reach it, conclude as it were with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, in the Euchariſt there's no <hi>tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Would that man be thought a good Chriſtan, who, becauſe it thwarts his groſſe underſtanding to conceive a father to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a ſon by ſpeaking, ſhould conclude that the divine word is not the ſon of the eternal Father? or a good divine, who, becauſe it's true to ſay in the B. Trinity that the eſſence is communicated to the ſon, and the peternitie is not communicated to the Son; ſhould conclude, that the eſſence and the paternitie are not the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>Here I remark in paſſing that <hi>Mr. Rodon's</hi> Philoſophy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warilie touches the myſterie of the moſt B. Trinity in his 4. <hi>chap.</hi> where <hi>numb.</hi> 12. for an example of a plurality of <hi>things</hi> really different he aſſignes the three Divine perſones and concludes from thence, that a real difference of <hi>things</hi> does not infer <hi>Diviſion.</hi> But he ſhould have taken notice that the <hi>Sacred Science</hi> teaches us that tho there be three different Perſones in God there are not three different things, becauſe A different thing ſignifies a different eſſence. Hence <hi>S. Aug. lib.</hi> de Fide ad petrum <hi>chap.</hi> 1. ſayes, <hi>Una eſt patris &amp; Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii &amp; Spiritus Sti. eſſentia, in qua non eſt aliud Pater, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud Filius, aliud Spiritus Sanctus; quamvis perſonaliter ſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Pater, alius Filius, alius Spiritus Sanctus.</hi> The eſſence of the Father, Son, and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is one, in which the Father is not one thing, the Son another, and the H. Ghoſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44999:24"/>
another; altho, as to Perſon the Father be one, the Son another, and the Holy Ghoſt another. If he was raſh in touching the B. Trinity we muſt not wonder to ſee him ſtray alſo in this Myſtery, following only the ſtrain of his human Philoſophy. Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> then was not content meerly to believe, but would ſee, that he might believe, tho <hi>S. Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>That ſuch a ſight is reſerved for the next Life, and that now we ſee only through a Glaſs darkly.</hi> But I deſire him who is ſo earneſt to have a clear accompt of Divine Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to clear me firſt in ſome natural things.</p>
                  <p>How is it poſſible to cover the whole Heavens with the Wing of a Fly? Yet this can be done if it be divided in as many parts as God can divide it. For after every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, the leaſt part will ſtill have its three dimentions, length, breadth, and thickneſs, by all which it may be ſtill divided.</p>
                  <p>Now if he deny this, ſaying the Wing is compoſed of Indiviſibles, he runs himſelf into as great difficulties, as to avow that a ſnail makes as much way in an hour as the ſleeteſt Race-Horſe; for the Race-Horſe cannot make an Indiviſible of ſpace or way without ſome part of time, and that cannot be leſs then an Indiviſible of time, and in the ſame Indiviſible of time the Snail moving can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make leſs then an Indiviſible of ſpace, and ſo go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the Race-Horſe the reſt of the Indivſiibles of the hour, and conſequently the Snail will have made as much way as the Race-Horſe at the hours end, which is abſurd.</p>
                  <p>Neither tell me the Horſe can run over a hundred points or parts of ſpace in an inſtant, for his motion is alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible in points, one part muſt begin afore the other, and ſo comes in again my argument: As for the <hi>ſweld points</hi> maintained by ſome, they confound a Body with a Spirit and therefore are to be rejected.</p>
                  <p>How is it poſſible, that, ſince three Men cannot get in at once at a narrow Door, the pictures or ſpecies (which are not Spirits but material things) of a whole
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44999:25"/>
Army ſhould all at once enter without confuſion into the apple of the Eye of a Man, who from an eminence regards it?</p>
                  <p>If all Philoſophers Wits are drowned in a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not being able to fell with ſatisfaction what is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or the Form of it, and whither it be compounded of diviſible or indiviſible parts, muſt we claim to a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our reaſon afore we will believe this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and thus baniſh Faith out of the Church of Chriſt? Let us not ſoare to high, nor dive to deep in this matter, ſince a ſearcher of the <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> will be oppreſſed by Glory. Having premitted this diſcourſe to raiſe Men above their ſenſes when they come to conſider myſteries of Faith. I now prove the myſtery of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> thus.</p>
                  <p>As God can create, ſo he can Tranſubſtantiate: And as he hath revealed, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. That he hath created Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, ſo he hath revealed, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 27. That he hath made a <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> of Bread into his Body in the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>If you wonder at the ſtrange things that follow from this <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> conſider that creation made ſomething of nothing, which ſeemed ſo ſtrange to the ancient Philoſophers, that they tell us flatly, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit, of nothing nothing is made.</hi> Had they had Faith, they would have acknowledged Creation; ſubmit you your Judgment to Faith, and you'l acknowledge in the Euchariſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>

                  <head>SECTION II. Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi>'s objections anſwered,</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> IN every ſubſtantial converſion that thing into which another thing is converted is alwiſe new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced, as when Chriſt turned the Water into Wine was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44999:25"/>
the Wine was newly produced. But the Body and Blood of Chriſt cannot be newly produced in the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Bread and Wine are not ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially converted into the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. I diſtinguiſh the Major. In every ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial converſion, that thing <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is alwiſe newly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Entitatively, or modally, I grant: alwiſe Entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, I deny; that is, in every ſubſtantial converſion there is alwiſe the production at leaſt of a new manner of being. So the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt has a new manner of being, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sacramental being, which it has not out of the Euchariſt. But there is not alwiſe in every ſubſtantial converſion a production of a new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 2. I diſlinguiſh the Major again. Naturally, be it ſo. Supernaturally, and when the queſtion is about the almighty Power of God, I deny it, and ſay that it is ſufficient that the whole ſubſtance of Bread be deſtroyed and the Bodie of Chriſt put in its place; ſomething remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common to both, <hi>viz.</hi> the accidents of Bread, which now by the conſecration become the accidents of the Body of Chriſt morally, in as much as they ſhew to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the conſecration being made, that the Body of Chriſt is now there; and receives a new being, not as to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which it had already, but as to the manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a ſacramental being, under the form of Bread.</p>
                  <p>If you ask how the Body of Chriſt can begin to be there without leaving the place where it was before. I anſwer, when a child grows by the nutrition or feeding, does the reaſonable ſoul leave the reſt of the Childs body to come to the added part of matter, or is there a new reaſonable Soul produced in it? If not, but the ſame Soul acquires only a new preſence of relation to the added part of matter, reaſon the ſame way concerning the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. In every ſubſtantial converſion that thing which is converted into another is deſtroyed; but the Bread is not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44999:26"/>
deſtroyed in the Euchariſt, becauſe after Conſecration it is ſaid to be Broken, Divided <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I diſtinguiſh the Minor. The Bread is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed as to the ſubſtance (which is only required) I deny; as to the accidents, I grant, and ſay that by reaſon of theſe remaining the Hoſt is ſaid to be broken, divided <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is ſtill called Bread <hi>Per diſtractionem</hi> as we ſpeak in Philoſophy. So our Saviour ſaid to the Diſciples of <hi>Iohn. Math.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 5. The blind ſee, becauſe they, who then did ſee, were afore blind. They were ſtill called Blind by that way of ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>If yow ask me what he invited them to drink when he ſaid to his Diſciples. <hi>Math.</hi> 26. <hi>Drink ye all of this? I</hi> anſwer be invited them to drink a cup of Blood, for the Wine was converted into Blood afore they drunk the cup, for the cup's being the cup of his blood was the reaſon he brought to move them to drink it, now we do not bring the reaſon to move a man to do a thing after he has done it, but before.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the demonſtrative particle <hi>This</hi> as it does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a thing that is not yet, neither does it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate a thing that is paſt, but joyned to a verb of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tence with a full ſenſe, it demonſtrates a thing preſent. <hi>If Chrict had</hi> meant of what they had drunk afore, he would have ſaid <hi>That was,</hi> and not, <hi>Tkis is,</hi> ſo you may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he did not give them the Cup afore he had ended his ſpeach.</p>
                  <p>But why does <hi>S. Mark, chap.</hi> 14. Set the conſecration after the drinking? Anſwer, it's a figurative ſpeach we call <hi>Hiſterologia,</hi> when we relate firſt that which was done laſt As when <hi>S. Math.</hi> in the 27 <hi>chap.</hi> relates the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bodies of the Saints afore the Reſurrection of Chriſt, who nevertheleſs roſe firſt. Again by the ſame figure <hi>S. Math. Chap.</hi> 11. from the 2 verſe to the 20 relates concerning <hi>Iohn Bap.</hi> the things that fell out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the miſſion of the Apoſtles, which miſſion he had related before in the 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> Nay I hope <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:44999:26"/>
will not have our Saviour to have conſecrated or bliſſed the wine by ſaying <hi>this is my blood</hi> when it was in the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſtomacks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Ro.</hi> urges. When a thing is converted into another wee cannot ſee the property of the thing converted, but only that into which it is converted. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In a natural converſion which is not a Sacrament, I grant; in a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, which makes a Sacrament, I deny; for the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt being a ſigne of our ſpiritual nouriſhment it is ſuch by the ſpecies of Bread which nouriſhes the body. Alſo the property of the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, which is to nouriſh the ſoul by Grace, being an object of ſaith is ſeen by the underſtanding, but not by the eye of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw by faith that thoſe who appeared to him <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. like men, were Angels.</p>
                  <p>For brevities ſake to his ſaying <hi>In everie ſubſtanſtial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, &amp;c.</hi> Anſwer in every ſubſtantial converſion which is not of the whole ſubſtance there muſt be a ſubject to paſſe from on ſubſtance to another, I grant; if it be of the whole, as Tranſubſtantiation, I deny; for God's almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power is able to change the matter as well as the form of a thing, when it pleaſes him. Neither is it a Creation, becauſe the accidents are ſomething common to both, and the Body of Chriſt was before exiſtent.</p>
                  <p>To his ſaying that Tranſubſtantiation deſtroyes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Accidents; this I deny, becauſe the nature of an accident is not to inhere actually, but to have an exigency or an innate appetite of inhering which a ſubſtance hath not: becauſe naturally a human nature demandes a human ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, would <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi> have ſaid that there is a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man perſon in Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>To his ſaying that Tranſubſtantiation deſtroyes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sacraments; that I alſo deny, and ſhew the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Becauſe the Body of Chriſt as it is united to the ſpecies of Bread is the Sacrament, which hath not only an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute being, but alſo a relative, Sacramental, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative being, as <hi>Mr, Ro.</hi> requires, for as the ſpecies of Bread repreſent and ſignify to us bread which nouriſhes the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44999:27"/>
Body, ſo do the ſame ſpecies by the Conſecration of the Hoſt repreſent to us the Body of Chriſt, which nouriſhes the ſoul by the grace it produces in it.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the ſpecies. an Analogie or relation to the thing ſignified <hi>viz.</hi> Nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A double being of the Sacrament; the abſolute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Bodie of Chriſt, and the Relative being in the Species. And ſo you ſee that Tranſubſtantiation does not any wiſe deſtroy the being of a Sacrament ar Sign.</p>
                  <p>Note that the ſubſtances of Bread alone or Wine alone are not ſigns, for ſubſtances do not fall under, or affect our ſenſes, but by their accidents, ſo the whole force of ſignifying is in the ſpecies which move our ſenſes, and conſequently 'tis not required that the formal ſigns be ſuch that they may nouriſh our Bodies to ſave the likeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sacrament and nouriſhment ſignified by it. It's enough that the ſpecies ſignifie nouriſhment in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, as they did afore in the Bread: in the Bread, nouriſhment of the Body by Bread; in the Euchariſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Soul by the Body of Chriſt. If you ſay the Body of Chriſt under the ſpecies cannot nouriſh the Soul. I anſwer. Materially and corporally, I grant; Effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Spiritually producing grace in it, I deny.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Mr. Ro.</hi> ſaying, The Council of Trent commands the adoration of the Euchariſt. And therefore the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Bread and Wine are not the Sacrament of the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The accidents are not a part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I deny, they are not the whole Sacrament, I grant. The Sacrament is ſaid to be adored when the cheif part of it, the Body of Chriſt united to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity is adored, for the ſpecies, they are only adored <hi>per accidens</hi> as the garment of Chriſt by him who ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his perſon.</p>
                  <p>To his ſaying a Sacrament is a viſible ſign of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible grace. But in the Euchariſt the Body and Blood of Chriſt are not viſible. Therefore in the Euchariſt they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44999:27"/>
are not the Sacrament. Anſwer I diſtinguiſh the mino<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> They are not a viſible ſign alone, I grant; joyned to the ſpecies I deny. Neither do we ſay That the Body and Blood alone are the Sacrament, nor the ſpecies alone but the Body and Blood joyned to the ſpecies are the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that whole is a viſible ſign.</p>
                  <p>To his ſaying that nothing can be both the ſign and thing ſignified. Anſwer. Nothing can be the ſign and the thing ſignified in the ſame manner in which it is the ſign I grant, in an other manner I deny. Did not the Angel give the ſheepheards for a ſign of our Saviour Born that they ſhould find a Child in a manger, who was the Saviour himſelf? He in the qualitie of a Child in a manger is a ſign of himſelf as the Born Saviour, So Chriſt in the Euchariſt may be a ſign of himſelf on the Croſs. Alſo a loafe of Bread expoſed in a window is a ſign of it ſelf to be ſold.</p>
                  <p>But to give you more, the Body united to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Bread is a viſible ſign, not of Chriſt's Body, but of the inviſible grace which this Sacrament produces in the Soul, ſo the ſign and the thing ſignified are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>

nature are of no force againſt the Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, it being thereafter the manner of a ſpirit. Yet when they are looked upon with an unlearned eye, Mr. de <hi>Rodon</hi> ſeems to triumph.</p>
                  <p>Juſt as if I ſpeaking with a country cloun of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun ſhould ſtrive to perſwade him that at the moſt it makes only twenty miles an hour, while another ſhould undertake to prove it makes twenty thouſand. My opinion would be received with more applauſe by the Cloun, than that of the other: but if both ſpoke t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> an Aſtronomer he would laugh at my opinion in reſpect of the other's.</p>
                  <p>What makes ſo different a ſentiment in theſe two Men? The Cloun is led by ſenſe, and the Aſtronomer by reaſon.</p>
                  <p>This is my caſe with <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi> treating this Queſtion. If we ſpeak to vulgar People, or to thoſe who have no Faith, <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi> will be applauded. If to Men of Faith and reaſon I'le have the better of him. Why? becauſe the vulgar, eſpecially if they want Faith, will believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that mounts above their ſenſes: But the wiſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian not meaſuring ſupernatural things by his Eye, or as they appear in his weak Imagination, but by Faith, and ſeing by his reaſon there is no contradiction in all <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi> brings againſt this Myſtery, more than againſt that of the Incarnation or of the moſt B. Trinity, hath no difficulty to ſubmit the judgment of his ſenſes often deceived in natural things to the word of God propoſed to him by the Church.</p>
                  <p>This preamble being made I now prove our tenet. Chriſt's Body has been circumſcriptively, that is, locally in its ſhape in two places both at once, then it may be in Heaven locally, and in the Hoſt or conſecrated Wafer Sacramentally both at once. I prove the antecedent. Chriſt ſtanding by <hi>Paul;</hi> as <hi>S. Luke</hi> relates, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 11. in theſe words <hi>The Lord ſtood by him and ſaid be of good cheer, Paul,</hi> was circumſcriptively or locally in that place, and at the ſame time he was in the Heavens,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44999:29"/>
which ſhall retain him till the general Reſurrection, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 21. therefore he was circumſcriptively or locally in two places both at once.</p>
                  <p>If yon ſay 'twas an Angel ſtanding by him that ſpoke to him from Chriſt, as one ſpoke to the <hi>Iews</hi> from God on mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> Then the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 8. ſaying, <hi>he, viz.</hi> Chriſt, <hi>was ſeen of me alſo.</hi> Were of no force to prove Chriſt's Reſurrection which he was proving there. For to ſee an Angel was not to ſee Chriſt. Yet he would perſwade them that he was riſen, becauſe he had ſeen him.</p>
                  <p>This is confirmed out of <hi>Io.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9. and 13. Where 'tis ſaid our Saviour fed 5000 Men with five Loaves and two Fiſhes. I ſuppoſe theſe Loaves were not buſhel Loaves for the Boy who had them, could not have carried them, but ordinary Loaves.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſay, that theſe five Loaves might feed 5000 Men, the ſame piece of Bread muſt have been in divers mouths at once, it being probable that Chriſt gave to each a competent piece: for if he Created other Loaves he did not then feed them all with five Loaves which is againſt Scripture.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the antecedent, and as to its firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation I diſtinguiſh; That which is produced already can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be produced as to its Eſſential being I grant, as to its manner of being, or as to a Sacramental being I deny. The ſecond probation I grant, and ſay that the term <hi>Aquo</hi> or of departure is the Body without the ſecond preſence, or relation, <hi>viz.</hi> to the ſpecies; the term <hi>Ad quem</hi> or of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving, the Body with the ſecond preſence to the ſpecies in the Euchariſt and theſe two terms are different.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> urges. If a Man would go from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt leave <hi>Paris;</hi> therefore Chriſt's Body which does not leave Heaven, neither comes nor is brought to the Hoſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. In the opinion of thoſe who explane the being of Chriſt's Body in the Hoſt by adduction, do not ſay that it's brought or comes thither Circumſcriptively by a proper Local motion, becauſe this motion ſuppoſes a Body to have it's parts anſwering to the parts of a place, which Chriſt's Body has not in its adduction to the Hoſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it does not leave Heaven, becauſe we do not leave the place in which we were, to go to another, but by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per local and continued motion. The equivocal and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered motion by which Chriſt's Body is adduced to all its Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental places is improperly called a motion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 2. I deny the antecedent, becauſe to put a Body in two places ſuffices the production of a ſecond ubication, for ubication is the formal reaſon making a thing to be in a place.</p>
                  <p>You'l ſay ſuppoſing that the Body exiſting at <hi>Paris,</hi> be put alſo at <hi>Rome,</hi> now either this Roman ubication is produced in the Body exiſting at <hi>Paris</hi> or exiſting at <hi>Rome;</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44999:30"/>
neither can be ſaid, not the firſt, becauſe the Roman ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation cannot be at <hi>Paris;</hi> not the ſecond, becauſe the Body would be at <hi>Rome</hi> before it had the Roman ubicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore the Body which is at <hi>Paris</hi> cannot be at the ſame time at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the major, and ſay that this Roman ubication is produced neither in the Body exiſting at <hi>Rome</hi> nor exiſting at <hi>Paris,</hi> but is produced in the Body <hi>ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſecumdum ſe</hi> conſidered in it ſelf, which indeed materially was afore at <hi>Paris,</hi> but by a new ubication is alſo at <hi>Rome.</hi> If you ſay the Roman ubication muſt be produced at <hi>Rome;</hi> but it cannot be produced at <hi>Rome</hi> unleſs it be produced in the Body exiſting at <hi>Rome:</hi> therefore the Body muſt be at <hi>Rome</hi> before it be at <hi>Rome,</hi> which is abſurd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I diſtinguiſh the minor. It cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at <hi>Rome</hi> unleſs it be produced in the Body exiſting at <hi>Rome</hi> conſecutively, I grant; antecedently, I deny. And therefore I alſo deny the conſequence. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ubication is then produced in the Body exiſting at <hi>Rome ut quo</hi> in as much as it is the Form, which makes the Body or the ſubject to be at <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. In a true human Body ſuch as Chriſt's Body is the Head is above the neck and the neck above the ſhoulders, but this cannot be in a Point; then Chriſt's Body cannot be in every leaſt part of the Hoſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I diſtinguiſh the major. In a true human Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> naturally exiſting the Head is above the neck, its true: ſupernaturally exiſting, being Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized or having the quality of a Spirit by which it is all in all and all in every part of the improper place in which it is, I deny the major.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> confounds here Entitative quantity which is to have a number of parts, with Situal quantity or Extent which is to have all its parts one without ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Body of Chriſt hath its Entitative quantity, but not its ſitual quantity in the Euchariſt this Extent
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44999:30"/>
or Situal quantity is an accident which the Entitative quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity can want.</p>

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Conſidered under the ſame reſpect its true; under a different reſpect its falſe. For example, my Soul moves in my hand at the ſame time that it is ſtock ſtill in my head. The ſame way the Body of Chriſt may be moved as it is in Heaven and not be moved as it is in the Hoſt.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I grant it, and tell you that a Body in two places is not two Bodies; ſo the relation of diſtance of which we ſpeak here, is between the two places, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi> urges. It is only the diſtance of places that makes the diſtance of things exiſting in them.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer</hi> once again, we are not ſpeaking here of things but of one thing. But let us ſpeak of two other things exiſting in two different places. I ſay that the diſtance of place is only the partial Cauſe of their diſtance, and that the total Cauſe is the dlſtance of places and the exiſting of things in them. Otherwiſe things which are now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether might be ſaid to be diſtant, becauſe the places in which they were before, are ſtill diſtant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi> preſſes further. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> might draw nigher to himſelf as he exiſts at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Neigher to himſelf I deny, neigher to his ubication at <hi>Paris,</hi> I grant; that is, he might have an ubication nigher to that he has at <hi>Paris,</hi> but he would never come ſo cloſe that the ſame parts of his Body would meet with the ſame, but the right hand with the left, or the palm of the hand with the back of the hand: And ſo as there is a difference between thoſe different parts there may riſe a relation of meeting; and as there is no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnance that I touch my ſelf making one hand touch the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo there is none, that I meet with my ſelf, different
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44999:31"/>
parts of my Body meeting with different parts of the ſame. And if I will have my right hand, which meets with my left, preſs forward, I muſt alſo will to put back or aſide my left, they being both ſolid parts.</p>
                  <p>Let my Reader take theſe anſwers to divert himſelf a litle with the humour of <hi>Mr. de Rodon;</hi> but let him not think that his objection preſſes us, for as diſtance ſuppoſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places, ſo meeting ſuppoſes a proper motion. And the Body of Chriſt is neither in a proper place, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly moved in the Euchariſt as I ſaid afore. But were it Circumſcriptively there, theſe foreſaid anſwers and the following in this matter blow-up all his objections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 5. It's a perfit contradiction that a Body ſhould be one, and not one; but if Chriſt's Body ſhould be at the ſame time in Heaven and in the Hoſt upon Earth 'twould be one, and not one: then it can not be in Heaven and in the Hoſt both at once. 'Twould be one as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and not one as is proven, becauſe it would be divided from it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the minor, and as to its probation I diſtinguiſh, 'Twould be divided from it ſelf Extrinſecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, as to place, I grant. Intrinſecally, as to it ſelf, or Eſſential principles of which it's compoſed, I deny. For nothing of it's Eſſential principles would be in one place, which were not in the other. The Body of a man, for example, bilocated would not be in one place where the Soul were not, nor the Soul in another where the Body were not with it. The ſole Ubications of the ſame Body are divided. Now ſince two Bodies may be in one place by penetration, as when Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Caenacle of the Apoſtles the Doors being ſhut, and came out of his B. Mother's womb ſhe ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Virgin, why may not one Body be by a like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in two places? ſince the thing placed relates to the place, juſt as the place relates to the thing placed in it. As one thing naturally requires to be in one place at once, ſo one place naturally requires to have only one thing in it at once, why then may not one thing ſupernaturally
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44999:31"/>
by the almighty power of God be in two places at once?</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> urges 1. The diviſion is true, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two there be Bodies of divers natures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This I grant, and ſay That our ſuppoſition is not of two, but of one Body which is the ſame in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in the Hoſt.</p>
                  <p>He urges 2. Things that are divided locally are alſo divided Entitatively: Therefore the Body of Chriſt being in divided places, muſt be divided Entitatively. He proves the antecedent thus, elſe no reaſon can be given why two glaſſes of Water taken from the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain are really different, ſince theſe Waters are like in all things except in reference to place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Our ſuppoſition is not of things, but of one thing or Body as I ſaid afore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 2. I grant that local diviſion infers alwiſe Entitative diviſion if we look only to the ordinary courſe of nature; but not in caſes, in which God will ſhew his almighty Power; we know then that the Body of Chriſt being only one, is now ſacramentally in different places by the almighty power of God, becauſe he hath revealed it, as we know the ſame Body was Circumſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely in different places, when being in Heaven he ſtood beſide Paul at the ſame time upon Earth. <hi>Act.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>A reaſon alſo is eaſily given why the Ocean is not one ſingle drop of Water, to wit, becauſe one drop is not naturally in innumerable places, but only by a miracle, which God does not ordinarily and for nothing. Neither is God and Nature to be ſaid to do in vain when they do according to the natural exigence of a drop of Water, which is to be only in one place at once. Is God bound to do all he can do?</p>
                  <p>Neither might one man replicated in 10000. places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in one night 10000. Children, becauſe his force is limited to the power of one man; the ſecond and third Ubication giving him no new force, but only a new place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:44999:32"/>Add to all this that God is in places divided from one another, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> both at once.</p>
                  <p>You'l ſay he is a Spirit; but I reply the reaſon that makes ſeem impoſſible for a Body to be together in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, is not ſo much it's bulk as its Unitie: But the Spirit is as much one Spirit, as one Body is one Body.</p>
                  <p>You'l ſay again that God, at the ſame time that he is in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> is in all places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> What if God by his almighty power ſhould annihilate or deſtroy both as to matter, and form Sea, Earth, and Aër, between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> would he ceaſe to be in both?

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 7. Chriſt's Body is not ſeen in the Hoſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 'Tis not ſeen with the eye of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elevated by Faith; I deny. With our corporal eye, I grant, and the reaſon is, becauſe it is not there in a way proportioned to our corporal ſight, or in its own ſhape; and it is ſo for the exerciſe of our Faith, which would ceaſe if we ſaw it in Glory. Was not Chriſt's Body glorious after his reſurrection, and yet did the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſee its Glory the fourty days he converſed with them afore his Aſcenſion?</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why Chriſt's Body is not ſeen in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt by our Corporal eye is, becauſe it has there no Extent, and is all in a point; not becauſe it's under the accidents, which hide it, or in another place then the accidents, they being above and it below, nor do Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers mean any ſuch thing when they ſay that ſubſtances are under their accidents, becauſe pure ſubſtances have no proper places, they mean only that the ſubſtances ſuſtentate or ſupport the accidents, in as much as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident naturally depends of its proper ſubject, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the ſubſtance of Bread, or Body of Chriſt in its place is ſupplied to the accidents in the Euchariſt by the almighty power of God. Juſt then as ſubſtances poſſeſs no place but by reaſon of their accidents, ſo the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt is in no place but by reaſon of the ſpecies which are in a place. And as ſubſtances which are under their accidents according to this way of ſpeaking of Philoſophers, are not ſeen, ſo neither the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt under the ſpecies, is ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> asks how can Chriſt's Body be without poſture
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44999:33"/>
and without external form ſeing (as we ſay) it is whole and entire in the whole hoſt, and in every part of it?</p>
                  <p>Anſwer. Becauſe, altho Chriſt's Body hath in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt all its eſſential extenſion, or all its parts in order to themſelves in the whole hoſt, and in every part of the hoſt (which we call to be whole and entire in the whole hoſt and in every part of the hoſt as our Soul is all in every part of the Body, and only all in the whole Body. Yet it hath not local extenſion in order to place which is a ſeparable property of eſſential extenſion, as actual heat is a ſeparable property of fire, as was ſeen by the almighty power of God in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Babilon; where, as he ſuſpended the operation of that element to manifeſt his glory, ſo he hinders the local extenſion of the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt and the light of its glory to exerciſe our faith.</p>
                  <p>And this anſwer's all Mr. <hi>Rodon's</hi> whimſical queſtions of the poſtures of Chriſt's Body in a whole or divided hoſt, ſince diviſion as well as the poſture of a Body depends of Local Extenſion. For if God put all the parts of a Body after a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner (as the Body of Chriſt is in the Euchariſt) in a point, and a point cannot be devided, in that caſe how will you devide that Body? and without deviding it you cannot make it appear leſs, how much ſo ever you devide the hoſt, In a word a viſible Body of a man is a man's Body in its ſhape, which the Body of Chriſt has not in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, for want of Local Extention, and therefore is not viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 8. Chriſt in the Hoſt can act, or not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> He can act, know and love, altho he hath not there the diſpoſition of Organs fit for thoſe operations, which require Local extention. We gratefully to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow that his Body in the <hi>H. Hoſt</hi> is <hi>Modo mortuo</hi> after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of one dead, and this is the change the Preiſt makes of this victime in his oblation of it to the eternal Father in the dayly Sacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
                  <p>And as Chriſt does not exerciſe there the operations, which depend of ſitual Extenſion, neither would the World reduced to a point or the parts of it, the Sun and Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:44999:34"/>
act as they do now, for want of ſitual diſpoſition to ſuch operations.</p>
                  <p>Neither do we ſay that Chriſt's Body is as big and as tall in the H. Hoſt as on the Croſs, as Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> inconſideratly alleadges, for that bigneſs on the Croſs comes from the ſitual extenſion he had there and wants in the H. Hoſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 9. A Body can not ceaſe to be in a place without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed or going to ſome other place: but the ſpecies being conſumed, Chriſts Body is neither diſtroyed nor goes to another place, therefore it was not in the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the major univerſally ſpeaking, and ask when a mans Leg is cut off, does the ſoul go to another place or is it deſtroyed? yet it ceaſes to be there. Reaſon the ſame way of the Body of Chriſt which is in the Euchariſt with the property of a Spirit, and as it came thither by the ſole production of a new preſence, ſo it ceaſes to be there by the ſole deſtruction of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 10. The properties of one ſpecies or of one nature are incommunicable to every other ſpecies or nature: but 'tis the property of a ſpirit to be all in all and every part of a place; therefore the Body of Chriſt can not be all in all and in every part of the Hoſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I grant the major and diſtinguiſh the minor. 'Tis the property of a ſpirit to be all in all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, I grant, by accident I deny. For example water has heat by accident, which Fire alone has by exigence, and therefore the exigence of heat is the property of Fire: and not the actual having of it, which is communicable to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The clame and exigence of ſeing God as he is in himſelf is the property of God flowing from his Eſſence in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to a creature; but the actual only ſeing of God as he is in himſelfe will be favorably communicated by him to happy men in the other world 1. <hi>Io.</hi> 3.2. And therefore rigidly ſpeaking is not his property. So then what a ſpirit has by exigenbe. the Body of Chriſt without confounding different ſpecies, may have by accident in the Euchariſt. <hi>Quaeres</hi> wherefor to be actually all in all, and all in every part of an improper place is cal'd the property of a ſpirit and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44999:34"/>
not of a Body largely ſpeaking? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Beeauſe a ſpirit has a natural appetite of that way of exiſting, which a Body has not, alſo becauſe a ſpirit is indiviſible, and has no partes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer..</hi> 2. I diſtinguiſh the major. The propertie of a ſpecies, that is, the exigence of one ſpecies is incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to an other, I grant; the act of the exigence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable, I deny. For example, Heat is the act of the exigence of Fire, and is communicated to water.</p>
                  <p>Hence I grant that naturally Bodies are in places circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptively, that is the parts of the Body are in the parts of the place and not the whole Body in every part. But not ſo if it pleaſe the author of nature to put them by his almighty power in places definitively or Sacramentally, that is, in an equivocal or improper place (which in rigour is no place) without local extenſion.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid definitively, or Sacramentally becauſe the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt is not limitated according to a rigid definitive way of exiſting, as the ſoul is in the Body, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a certain continued place, but is without limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in as many diſcontinued ſacramental places, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is made in.</p>

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I retort his argument thus. If he, whom we call Chriſt, was God, God was ſubject to many igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minies to be called a Seducer, a Blaſphemer, a Drinker of Wine, a Glutton, to be ſcurged at a poſt like a rogue and hanged like a theef; therefore he was not God.

                     <hi>Monſr. Rodon.</hi> ſpeaking of the Euchariſt, ſayes; as it is a God that cannot keep himſelfe from being ſtolen, ſo neither can he keep himſelf from heing burned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. did not the Jews deride Chriſt the ſame way upon the Croſs? Save thy ſelf, <hi>If thou art the Son of God come down from the Croſs. Math.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 40.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 2. then he could have come down from the Croſs, and can hinder alſo the Hoſt from being prophaned. But the firſt he ſuffered for the love of man, the ſecond he ſuffers for the exerciſe of our faith.</p>
                  <p>Note, the Body of Chriſt ceaſes to be in the ſtomack when the ſpecies are altered there, but, did it joyn with the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they could not annoy or hurt him no more then a dung-hill defiles the beams of the Sun. Nay the Body of Chriſt now impaſſible were not worſe in Hell it ſelf, than at the right hand of his father.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Claude de Xainte's,</hi> ſaying we exclude not one from the true and corporal receiving of the Lord's fleſh in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament let him be Turk, Atheiſt, yea tho he ſhould be the Divel himſelf incarnate.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That is to be underſtood if his unworthineſs be unknown to the Prieſt, or known only by Confeſſion. For of this he cannot make uſe to diffame him: Did not Chriſt give the Communion to Judas?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 12. God makes no miracles without neceſſity, but what neceſſity is there for the miracles we avow to be made in the Euchariſt? Then they are not made there, and ſo Chriſt's Body is not there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I diſtingiſh the major, without an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, I deny. Without a certain conſequential neceſſity ſuppoſing that he will make an extraordinary ſhew of his power or goodneſs, I grant. And this was the reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44999:35"/>
he made ſo many miracles, which were not abſolutely neceſſary in the bringing the Children of Iſraël out of Egipt, to wit, to give an extraordinary ſhew of his power. And in the Euchariſt he makes ſome, where he would alſo give an extraordinary ſhew of his ſingular goodneſs and love to man, fore-told by the Royal Prophet. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>He hath made a memory of his marvellous works,</hi> to wit, in giving his <hi>Body and Blood</hi> to be a ſpiritual Food to theſe who fear him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> asks here if it can be ſaid that the Euchariſt is for the Salvation of the Soul of him that eats it, ſince the reprobate eates it too, and the Faithful under the Old Teſtament and Infants in the New do not eat it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Yes it can be ſaid, becauſe 'tis the reprobate's fault that it does not ſave him. Neither that the Faithfull of the Old Law and Infants in the New are not ſaved by an eating of it, makes any thing againſt it, becauſe it was not inſtituted for them.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> askes again, if it can be ſaid with <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> and <hi>Perron,</hi> that the Hoſt being eaten ſerves as an incorruptable Food for a glorious reſurrection, ſince the Faithfull of the Old Teſtament and Infants in the New riſe again gloriouſly without it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Yes, it can be ſaid, becauſe Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Io.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 54. <hi>Who eates my Fleſh and drinks my Blood hath eternal Life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> And the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> calles the Euchariſt <hi>Symbolum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectionis a token of the Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now if you ask the manner how it ſerves as an Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Food for a glorious Reſurrection?</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> the ſpecies being altered by the heat of the ſtomach, the Body of Chriſt ceaſes to be there, but his Diety remaines after a ſpecial manner in the Soul (as the virtue of Wheat remaines in the corrupted Grain to raiſe it again at Spring) feeding it with grace, and at ſet times affording it new infuſions of actual Grace, divine
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44999:36"/>
lights and heavenly affections: And in the Reſurrection raiſes again the Body and unites it to this Soul. But this propoſition being affirmative does not exclude from Glory, thoſe of the Old Teſtament and Infants of the New, who have not for want of Capacity the Participation of this Sacrament. Who ſayes that a Ship ſerves to go from <hi>Leith</hi> to <hi>London</hi> does not ſay that a man cannot go without it, <hi>viz.</hi> by Horſe. Neither is S. <hi>Paul</hi> againſt us but for us, when he ſayes <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>If the Spirit of him who raiſed up IESVS from the dead dwell in you, he ſhall alſo quicken your mortal Bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you, viz.</hi> as the efficient and the immediate cauſe, this Spirit being the ſeed and virtue left by the Euchariſt, the eating of which was a remote cauſe conveiging in a particular manner by way of diſpoſition this Spirit to us.</p>

                  <p>I prove my ſubſumption. Chriſt gives there to the purer Souls ſurpriſing delights, and works admirable changes in them, which is a manifeſtation of his power, and a ray of his glory there, this is known to the faithful, which made the heavenly enlightened Author of the following of Chriſt, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. ſay, <hi>O admirahle and hidden grace of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which the faithful only of Chriſt know!</hi> If you ſay this is not ſenſible to the imperfiter Souls amongſt Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Monſieur <hi>Rodon</hi>'s Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Adoration of Chriſt in the H. Hoſt Anſwered.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. WE do not adore God in a Stone, or a Tree, nor Chriſt in the Water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, altho God be in the Stone, and the Tree, and what is adorable in Chriſt, is in the Water of Baptiſm: therefore, altho Chriſt were in the Hoſt, we ſhould not adore him there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the conſequence and give the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. A Stone, a Tree, and Water are compleat beings, ſo becauſe men have adored ſuch things, he, who bends his knee to adore God in them may be thought to adore them, as well as God in them. But in the Euchariſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> being only the compleat <hi>Being,</hi> and the Species only an accident never conſidered as Adorable by men; when we ſee a man adore the Euchariſt, we preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he Adores <hi>Chriſt</hi> there. An other diſparity is that the Divinity is Hypoſtatically, (<hi>i. e.</hi> perſonally) united to the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not to a Stone, a Tree, or the Water in Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. We are only obliged to adore God in all places in which he appears in his glorious Majeſty. Therefore Chriſt or God is not to be adored in the Euchariſt, altho he be really there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the antecedent. For Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> in this fift Chapter numb. 7. Will have tht Beams of Glory, which oblidge us to Adoration, to be ſenſible in that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44999:38"/>
place, in which the Adoration is made, and conſequently thouſands may have lived according to his Doctrine four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or fifty Years, and dyed without having been ever obliged to adore God: becauſe all that time the Beams of Glory which God ſhews to his Angels in Heaven were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſenſible to them, (they knowing it only by Faith) neither was his Glory ſenſible to them upon Earth, as to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> by any miraculous Beam.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quaeres</hi> 1. What meant Chriſt commanding his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles when they Prayed, to ſay <hi>Our Father who art in Heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Not that they ſhould only adore God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or where he makes appear, as there, a Beam of his glorious Majeſty, but that they ſhould weane their affections from the Earth, by an apprehenſion of the Glorious ſight which he ſhews to his Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quaeres</hi> 2. What meant the Apoſtles commanding in the Preface of the Liturgy or Chriſtian ſacrifice to ſay <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum corda, Lift up your harts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Not that when we are preſent at the Sacrifice <hi>We lift</hi> up our corporal Eyes to Heaven to adore God only there; but to raiſe our minds above our ſenſes, and our thoughts above nature to believe this ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral work done in the Sacrifice, and ſo become partakers of its Fruit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 3. We do not adore Chriſt in that Hoſt which the Prieſt has newly eaten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Becauſe it is not then morally preſent to us.</p>
                  <p>Note, I take no notice of Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi>'s ſpeaking of Chriſt's appearing in the Hoſt ſometimes in Form of a Child, becauſe as he does not credit ſuch ſtories, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I look upon them as matters of Faith, nor have I any need for my purpoſe to alledge them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 4. In lawful Adoration we muſt be aſſured that what we adore is the true God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This I grant and ſay that the Eſſential part
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44999:39"/>
of Adoration <hi>(honor eſt in honorante)</hi> is in my mind, which being directed to Chriſt, if he be not there, reſts not upon the piece of Bread, but goes to him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: So we know what we Worſhip and are ſure 'tis God. And to move me to adore 'tis enough that I am morally aſſured of the preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Hoſt. For we have no more than morall aſſurance to oblige us under the pain of breaking the commandment of God to honour and obey ſuch or ſuch a man for my Father: And to uſe his compariſen, as the Woman who doubts if ſuch a man be her Husband ought not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him as a Husband; no more ought a Catholick to adore an Hoſt if he prudently doubt of its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</p>
                  <p>But it is not prudent to doubt if any Hoſt be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, when it is propoſed to be adored, becauſe ſome have counterfited the Preiſt, who were not, or being really, may have maliciouſly (tho to their own damnation) omitted the intention. As it were not prudent in me to doubt if ſuch a man were my Father, for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe many have thought him to be their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who really was not.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Mr. Rodon</hi>'s ſaying, That Heathens might have retorted the Catholick arguments made againſt them by S. <hi>Chryſoſ. &amp;c.</hi> If the Church had then believed that Chriſt's Body was in the Euchariſt: As when S. <hi>Chriſoſ.</hi> ſaid, <hi>they bring their gods into baſe Images of Wood and Stone, and ſhut them up there as in Priſon.</hi> And <hi>Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Your Gods dwells in Plaiſter, &amp;c. and they ſuffer themſelves to be ſhut up and remain hid, and detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an obſcure Priſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. No, they might not, becauſe our my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries were not known then to them as they are now to Proteſtants. Nay they were keep ſecret from the very <hi>Catechumens.</hi> Hence that famous ſaying in primitive times, ſpeaking of his Myſtery <hi>norunt Fideles, The Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful know,</hi> to wit what we believe there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quaeres,</hi> Why was this Myſtery concealed from the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44999:39"/>
cathecumens, or thoſe who ware not yet Baptized?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Becauſe they had not yet the Eye of Faith, by which they might ſee it, Hence don't wonder if you find ſome Fathers to have wrot ſome what obſcurely of this Myſtery in the Birth of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 2. No, the Heathens might not equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe 1. Chriſt is in the H, Hoſt, and was in his Mothers Womb; ſo that his God-head is and was elſe where. 2. We do not ſay, That Chriſt leaves Heaven to come to the H. Hoſt as the falſe Gods one place to come to another. 3. Their Conſecration was the meer word of Man, ours the words of Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Do this,</hi> and ſpeaking by the mouth of the Preiſt <hi>This is my Body.</hi> 4. They adored the Mettal after its dedication as God; We do not adore ſo the ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 3. If the Church did then believe that Chriſt had remained hid, and ſhut up in his Mothers Womb as in an obſcure Priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might not the Heathens have retorted what <hi>Arnob. Lib.</hi> 6. ſaid againſt their Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in an obſcure Priſon, And for their Retortion in this particular, would Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> have denyed that Chriſt remained nine months in his B. Mother's Womb?</p>
                  <p>I end this Chapter with this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quaere.</hi> Wherefore do we adore Chriſt more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the B. Sacrament then his God-head every where?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Becauſe God the Father will have God the Son ſpecially honoured by men for his ſpecial Love to them in their Redemption, of which we are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly minded by the preſence of his Body in the Euchariſt. 2. Becauſe the humanity of Chriſt repreſented to us by the Euchariſt is perſonally united to the Divinity.</p>
                  <p>And God the H. Ghoſt, who guides the Church, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired her in her invocations of the three Divine Perſons in the begining of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> to invoce the firſt and third Perſon under the common name of LORD, <hi>Lord have mercy on us.</hi> But God the Son under the Name of his

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. THE precept of Communicating, or of taking the Body and Blood of Chriſt, is only <hi>Io.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 53. in theſe words, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood ye have no Life in you.</hi> But with thoſe words ſtands the lawfulneſs of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating under one kind: Therefore 'tis lawful to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate under one kind.</p>

                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:44999:40"/>I prove the minor. 1. Becauſe there is only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſumption, or receiving of both Body and Blood as to the ſubſtance, not the manner of receiving them under both kinds. 2. If you think the manner is commanded alſo, giving, not granting you that; we anſwer that the Particle, <hi>And,</hi> may be taken for, <hi>Or,</hi> as in many other places of Scripture, for example when <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaking to God ſayes, <hi>mendicitatem &amp; divitias ne dederis mihi, Poverty and Riches give me not.

                  <p>If with the <hi>Huſſits</hi> you will not reliſh this ſolution, then we anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this command was given by Chriſt not to every particular man but to the community of Chriſtians, by which it is fulfilled, ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> Preiſts, taking it under both kinds to repreſent &amp; announce to the People the death of Chriſt, according to the command layed upon them <hi>Math.</hi> 26. In theſe words <hi>Do this in remembrance of me</hi> (there alſo was the command to the Preiſts of making the Sacrament for the People.) So <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 3. 'tis commanded that <hi>The whole multitude of the Children of Iſrael ſhall Sacrifice, viz.</hi> the Paſchal Lamb. Did every one in particular ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? No, but only the heads of families in their families. Alſo <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Increaſe and multiply.</hi> Doth not oblige every particular man to marry.

                  <p>Now to make appear that this anſwer is not brought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground from Scripture: take notice that when Chriſt would ſignifie that every one, or every individual perſon ſhould be baptiſed, he expreſſed himſelf in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Io.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Niſi quis, &amp;c.

manducaveritis, Unleſs ye eat, &amp;c.</hi> which is fulfilled by the community, if ſome of them receive under both kinds, altho all do not. And a little after when he turnes his ſpeach into the ſingular he ſpeaks indifferently of both or one kind, <hi>He that eates my Fleſh and drink my Blood hath life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> v. 45. and v. 58. <hi>He that eates this Bread ſhall live for ever.</hi> Which paſſages ſignifie that one kind ſuffices, for if by an impoſſible ſuppoſition Chriſt could contradict himſelf, yet our opinion would ſtand; ſince <hi>in jure</hi> if what is ſaid laſt, contradict what was ſaid afore, <hi>Iura poſteriora corrigunt prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, The latter Law corrects the former.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the precept of receiving this Sacrament was here, <hi>Io.</hi> 6. <hi>v,</hi> 53. I prove again. The command of receiving the Sacrament of Baptiſm, or Baptiſm Sacramentally was <hi>Io.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4. For in no other place is mentioned Water, which Proteſtants acknowledge to be neceſſary in Baptiſm as well as Catholicks, Therefore the command of receiving the Sacrament of Chriſts Body &amp; Blood Sacramentally, <hi>viz.</hi> in a ſenſible way by the mouth of the Body is here, <hi>Io.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 53, I prove the conſequence, becauſe a like expreſſion to the ſame people caries a like command, but <hi>Io.</hi> 3. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Baptiſm. ſaying, <hi>Except a man be born of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c.</hi> Then he commands the receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his Body and Blood, ſaying, <hi>Except ye eat, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> The command of receiving the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt was <hi>Math.</hi> 26. in theſe words, <hi>Take eat this is my Body, Drink ye all of it this is my Blood</hi> But there both kinds are particularly commanded, therefore 'tis not ſufficient to receive under one kind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. I deny the major, and ſay that thoſe words were not a precept but an invitation only made to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>alone,</hi> as a Friend does to his Friends invited to Dine with him. For when S. <hi>Mark Chap.</hi> 14. ſayes <hi>They all drunk of it.</hi> All thoſe who drunk were all thoſe, or comprehended all thoſe, who were bid <hi>drink,</hi> but all thoſe, who drunk, were only the Apoſtles, then all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44999:41"/>
thoſe who were bid drink, were only the Apoſtles; and conſequently if you make it a command, 'twas a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand only obliging the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 2. The waſhing of the Feet to one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Io.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 14. was not a precept, therefore far leſs theſe words, <hi>Take eat:</hi> for there he ſayes poſitively, <hi>Debetis alter alterius,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ye ought to waſh one another's Feet, for I have given you an example that ye ſhould do as I have done to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of my anſwer to the Objection,</p>
                  <p>Remark that the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. from the <hi>v.</hi> 23, to 27. relates only what Chriſt did to the Apoſtles, and what he commanded them, <hi>viz.</hi> as they were Preiſts, to wit to make this Sacrifice in remembrance of his death, telling them that as often as they eat that Bread, and drink that Cup, they ſhould announce his Death, <hi>viz.</hi> by their ſeparate tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſpecies of Bread from that of Wine. Then S. Paul of himſelf adds. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eate this Bread or drink the Cup of our Lord unworthily will be guilty of the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> As if he had ſaid, altho you eate the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord in a good eſtate, if you drink the Cup after, having conceaved in your heart afore the drinking a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſin you are guilty of both unworthily receaved. Why? but becauſe under each kind both are contained; And thus on the contrary, we receave the eſſential good effect of both under one kind, as we incurr the guilt of both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning both by an unworthy receaving under one. I know ſome Proteſtant Bibles have <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread And drink this Cup. &amp;c.</hi> 1. Cor. 11. v. 25. <hi>AND</hi> for <hi>OR</hi> but that is a corruption as you may ſee in the <hi>Greek</hi> Printed at <hi>London</hi> the year 1653. by <hi>Roger Daniel</hi> which has, <hi>OR,</hi> with the Latin verſion.</p>
                  <p>By this eſſential effect of the Sacrament we diſtinguiſh what belonges to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, from what belonges not to it. For example becauſe in Baptiſm by aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is had the ſame effect of the Sacrament as by a triple merſion, we conclude the triple merſion is not of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Say the ſame of one kind in the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44999:42"/>
For I hope Proteſtants will not ſay that when Chriſt gave the Sacrement in the time of Supper, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 26. Under the forme of Bread, the effect of the Sacrament was ſuſpended till he gave the Cup after ſupper, <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 20. If not, then the giving of the Cup was not neceſſary for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving the Grace of the Sacrament. This Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> ſeems to avow in his 12 number of this Chapter, when he ſayes <hi>Drinking of Wine is a corporal action, and therefore comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to thoſe only that can drink it.</hi> I infer then they who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not drink it, may have the effect of the Sacrament without the Cup. And this the Calveniſts muſt ſay in France when they give the Euchariſt under the kind of Bread only to thoſe who cannot taſt wine, as you may ſee in their 7 <hi>Art.</hi> of the 12 <hi>Chap.</hi> of their diſcipline which is of our Lord's Supper. And Mr. <hi>Jurieux</hi> a Miniſter in France confirmes this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in his book entituled <hi>Le Preſervatif, &amp;c. Pag.</hi> 267. When ſpeaking of the Perſon who has receaved only under one kind. This, ſays he.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N'eſt pas un veritable ſacrement quant au ſigne, mais c'eſt un veritable ſacrement quant a la choſe ſignifieé, puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que le fidele recoit</hi> J. <hi>Chriſt, ſignifie par le ſacrement, &amp; rccoit tout autant de graces que ceux qui communient au Sacrement meme, &amp; que le Sacrement luy eſt preſente tout entier de voeu &amp; de caeur.</hi> That is, This, ſayes he, is not a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to the ſign, but 'tis a true Sacrament as to the thing ſignified: ſince the faithful receives J. Chriſt ſignified by the Sacrament, and receives as much grace as thoſe who receave the Srcrament it ſelf, and that the whole Sacrament is repreſented to him to his ſight and heart.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ſince <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believe they receive not only the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, but alſo the proper ſubſtance of JESUS CHRIST at leaſt by ſaith. I aſk, when they have received the Bread of our Lord's Supper before the Cup, have they received the whole ſubſtance of Chriſt? or not? If they have received the whole, then they have received the whole Grace of the Sacrament, and conſequently the Cup is not neceſſary. If not. I aſk again is the ſubſtance of Chriſt divided? of which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44999:42"/>

'Twas Chriſt only who gave the command of eating his Body and drinking his Blood as to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, but not as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which certainly is not of the Eſſence of the Sacrament, the Sacrament being a permanent thing (for Chriſt having ſaid <hi>This is my Body,</hi> 'twas now a Sacrament before the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to that of S. <hi>Aug. tract.</hi> 80. <hi>in Io.

And conſequently when we receive it in the Sacrament, it has Blood by coneomitance, and therefore we need not receave the Blood a part. It's true alſo that Chriſt's Body at the laſt Supper or in the ſacrifice is day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken as to the ſpecies, but not in it ſelf, and therefore being a living Body it hath Blood by concomitance, and for this reaſon we need not take the Blood a part.</p>

So the Proteſtants go from the practiſe of primitive times in Baptiſm, by uſing now the ſprinkling of water on the Child, whereas a triple dipping was uſed in primitive times. I ſaid, be it ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in primitive times they gave it alſo ſometimes under one kind.</p>
                  <p>If you ask me why Chriſt gave it to his Apoſtles under both kinds?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer he both foreſaw Hereticks, as the <hi>Manicheans</hi> who would deny the thing in it ſelf to be lawful (which is an errour) and different circumſtances in which the Church ſhould think good to give it under the ſpecies of Wine, as to infants: which action of his juſtified the Church in that, and the like circumſtances. We avow then that the Sacrament was given ſome times under both kindes, and in particular to diſcover the <hi>Manicheans</hi> in the time of S. <hi>Leo</hi> Pope.

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 2. He doth not drink as to the ſubſtance of drinking, which is to take a liquid matter by the mouth, I deny.

The ſacramental words operate what they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, but they ſignify the ſeparation of the Body from the Blood; therefore they operate the ſeparation of the Body from the Blood, and conſequently we ought to receave under both kinds to receave both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I diſtinguiſh the Major. The Sacramental words operate what they ſignifie formally, I grant; what they ſignify occaſionally, I deny. And ſay that theſe words

                  <p>I ſaid <hi>be it ſo,</hi> becauſe the Sacraments were cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtituted to ſignify and cauſe in us ſanctifying grace which is both ſignified and cauſed by the Body and Blood of Chriſt under on kind as much as under both: Yet the other kind is neceſſary in the Prieſt, not to confirm more God's promiſe, as Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> would have it, but to repreſent the death of Chriſt. And ſince he thinks two Sacraments better then one, why does not he take in the Sacrament of Pennance ſo ſignally ſet down <hi>Io.</hi> 20. as a ſenſible ſign of ſanctifying Grace brought forth in a penitent Soul by the abſolution of the Preiſt, ſignified by theſe words <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remitt are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them.</hi> Since three Sacraments are as much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then two, than two are better than one.

                  <p>

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny that either Chriſt or S. <hi>Paul</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the lay people to take the Euchariſt under both kinds, more then Chriſt commanded that the Miniſters ſhould waſh the Communicants feet by his example of Waſhing them to thoſe to whom he gave the Sacrament. <hi>See</hi> the ground of this my denial in the 1. Sect. of the 6. chap. nay Chriſt ſignified aboundantly one kind to ſuffice when he ſaid, <hi>Who eates this Bread ſhall live for ever.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Cup is not taken from all lay people for that reaſon, but becauſe that, and other reaſons being on one ſide, and on the other ſide it not being neceſſary to give it the lay people for the proofs I have brought above, the Church doth not think good to give it at this time, which ſhe may change (it not being a matter of Faith or Command of God) when ſhe pleaſes. But the word of God is neceſſary to thoſe who hear, becauſe Faith comes by hearing, and is alwayes ſupplyed to the deaf by outward ſigns, and ſtronger inward inſpirations from God.</p>
                  <p>Be pleaſed to reflect that Mr. <hi>Rodon,</hi> who inveighes againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for taking away the Cup to avoid ſcandals or inconveniences; for one of the ſame allows in this 6. Chap. numb. 13. to ſubſtitute rather the ordinary drink of a Country inſtead of Wine, notwithſtanding that Chriſt inſtituded it to be given in Wine.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The diſcovery of Mr. <hi>Rodon's</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous repreſentation of the Decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Conſtance. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe taking away, ſays Mr. <hi>Rodon,</hi> of the Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Cup, was eſtabliſhed as an Article of Faith by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, repreſentative aſſembled in the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> in the Year 1414. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13. in a Canon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That's a Calumny, as ſhall appear in the diſcuſſion of his quotation. It is indeed an Article of Faith, to believe that under the ſpecies of Bread is both Chriſt's Body and his Blood, becauſe his Body is a living Body; <hi>He dyes no more, Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9. Wherefore the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> finding the Church to have been in a long cuſtome of giving the Sacrament under one kind for good reaſons; to ſhew that the former Church had not erred in that cuſtome, thought good to order them to be puniſhed as Hereticks, who ſhould preſume to ſay that that cuſtome was erroneous, ſacrilegious and unlawful. But why puniſhed as Hereticks? Becauſe they ſeem to doubt if the Blood be under the Form of Bread.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſhe did not define to be believed as an Article of Faith, and of divine right for Lay-people to take it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under one kind, for it's only of Church right, for ſome particular reaſons, which were not at the time the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44999:45"/>
Apoſtles gave it. One of which is this ſame which moved the Council: Another, the Church being now extended to Countries, where 'tis hard to get ſo much Wine, and many being found in the great body of the Church, who have an antipathy to Wine, ſince ther's no neceſſity, its better in the way of taking, to keep an uniformity in the ſick (to whom it could not be keept or conveniently carried, nor was carried in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times) and in thoſe who are in health; and ſo avoid ſcruples which might ariſe in weak heads: not to ſpeak of the danger of irreverence in ſpilling, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Chriſtians being not now ſo fervent as they were in the firſt age. Yet we do not hold it unlawful <hi>jure divino, by divine right,</hi> for Lay-people to receive under both kinds more then 'tis unlawful <hi>jure divino,</hi> to eat Fleſh on Frydays. Since it is at preſent the practiſe of the Greek Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> to give the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Lay-people once a Year, under both kinds.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſhew the infidelity of Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi>'s quotation of the Council's decree. <hi>The Council ſayes,</hi> 
                     <q>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens Concilium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> definit quod licè: <hi>Chriſtus</hi> inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerit &amp; dederit Sacramentum hoc poſt cocnam ſub u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traque ſpecie Diſcipulis, hoc non obſtante approbata conſuetudo eccleſiae ſervarit &amp; ſervat quod hujuſmodi Sacramentum non debet confici poſt cocnam, neque a fidelibus recipi non jejuuis <hi>(Here the Council ſhould have added</hi> neque ſub utraque ſpecie, <hi>to make out what</hi> Mr. Rodon <hi>ſayes, which it hath not</hi>) niſi in caſu in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitatis aut alterius neceſſitatis a jure vel Eccleſiae conceſſo. <hi>That is,</hi> The preſent Council defines; &amp;c. That altho <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtituted and gave this Sacrament AFTER SVPPER (<hi>theſe Words</hi> Mr. Rodon <hi>leaves out</hi>) under both kinds to his Diſciples, notwithſtanding this the approved cuſtome of the Church has obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and obſerves that this Sacrament ought not to be made AFTER SVPPER nor to be received by the Faithful who are not faſting <hi>(theſe words again,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44999:46"/>
which</hi> alone <hi>relate to the Council's ſaying,</hi> NON OB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTE, <hi>he leaves out</hi>) unleſs in caſe of Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or other neceſſity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> allowed by the Law of the Church.</q> Where the Council does not ſpeak at all of both kinds, when it ſayes, <hi>This notwithſtanding</hi> but only of the time of Communicating, whither <hi>AFORE</hi> or <hi>AFTER SVPPER. Viz.</hi> Altho our Saviour, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted it after Supper, that does not hinder the Church's now ordaining it to be taken only by thoſe, who are faſting unleſs in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Note, as the Council learned from the H. Ghoſt that Chriſt's giving it after Supper did not hinder to take it faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in another circumſtance of time; ſo it alſo learned from the ſame that the Primitive Church's giving it under both kinds (ſhe giving it alſo ſometimes under one as to the ſick, ſee <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 44. <hi>Edit. val.</hi> in the Hiſt. of <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion:</hi> alſo ſee <hi>Tertul: de orat. cap.</hi> 14. and to Infants, ſee S. <hi>Cypr. sract. de Lapſ.</hi>) did not hinder to make a Law at that time to give it to the laytie only under one or ſpecial reaſons; one of which is this, <q>
                        <hi>Since this cuſtome</hi> (ſaith the Council in the ſame place) <hi>hath been reaſonably brought in by the Church and Holy Fathers, it ought to ſtand for a Law which it is not lawful to diſapprove or change at pleaſure without the authority of the Church.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither does the Councill ſay not withſtanding Chriſt's command, but only not withſtanding his <hi>Example.</hi> Now Chriſt had a particular reaſon why he gave it after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Typical Sacrifice of the Paſchal Lamb might go afore the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt, which was figured by it. Alſo to conform himſelf to the cuſtome of thoſe times which was to ſacrifice after meat in thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: and the Church an other particular reaſon to give it ſince to none but faſting, becauſe Chriſtians fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the primitive ſervour eate and drunk intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly, of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> complains 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 22. and ſo rendered themſelves unworthy, not having that purity of Soul, which our Lord gave to underſtand as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44999:46"/>
a thing required by waſhing his Diſciples Feet afore he gave them the Srcrament.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt then commanded the ſubſtance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be given, but left the manner of giving it to the Church, changeable in a different circumſtance of Times and Perſons. That particle then of the Council <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> imports only, that Chriſt's giving the Sacrament AFTER SUPPER does not hinder it to be given to thoſe who are Faſting. And indeed if that were a breach of his will, do not <hi>Proteſtants</hi> break it as well as we? do not they take their Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Supper, and for the moſt part Faſting? If the Example of Chriſt were to be followed in the Ceremony of giving it, the Preiſt or Miniſter ſhould afore waſh the Feet of thoſe to whom he gives it.</p>
                  <p>To what Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> ſays, at the beginning of this Chapter of the Churches forbidding Marriage and certain Meats.</p>
                  <p>After Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> had unadviſedly ſaid that we freely confeſs, that the Decree of the Council of Conſtance is contrary to the inſtitution and command of Chriſt, which we are ſo far from confeſſing that we have proven the contrary.</p>

                        <p>WE muſt not refuſe to Chriſtians that, which all other People have had by an inſtinct of nature, <hi>viz.</hi> to offer a true Sacrifice to the Supream Being. God in the 1. <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Leviticus v.</hi> 2. does not

ſay by way of command, <hi>ye ſhall offer.</hi> But ſuppoſing what they knew to be done by the light of Nature, he only preſcribes there the manner of Sacrificing.</p>
                        <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> having cured with a word of his month a Lame man at <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> the People thinking him for that to be God, preſently found themſelves naturally moved to bring Oxen to Sacrifice to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p>Men Sacrificed in the Law of Nature, in the written Law, the <hi>Pagan</hi> infidel as well as the Faithful Soul all led by this innate light, <hi>he is to be honoured in a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner who is above all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The chief end of a Sacrifice is to acknowledge by it God's ſupream Dominion over us his Creatures as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Life and Death, and ſhall Chriſtians, who have been by divine favour enlightened above other People, be ignorant of this, or leſs ſenſible, than others of their duty to him, from whom they have received more Grace? No. Then Chriſtians have a true Sacrifice, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than that of the Maſs, then that of the Maſs is a true Sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>I prove the minor propoſition, becauſe, beſide the Sacrifice of the Maſs, Chriſtians have now no Sacrifice but their offerings of Prayers or other Acts of vertue, which are only Sacrifices improperly; nay God himſelf diſtinguiſhes them from a true Sacrifice, ſaying by the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Obedience is better then Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Math.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That is paſt. People in ſucceeding Ages could not be preſent at that, to do their due homage to God. That was made, and was ſufficient to Redeem all men from their Sin's paſt, preſent, and to come, as much as was required of Chriſt, or on his ſide as Redeemer, but it was not made to Redeem them from their firſt Duty to God, which is ſtill, and ever to acknowledge him as Supream Lord, as well in all other times, as in that, at which the Sacrifice of the Croſs was offered.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="78" facs="tcp:44999:49"/>If that Sacrifice ſufficed for all Duty's, what need have we now of Sacraments, Faith repentance <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> If we have moreover need of Faith for our ſelves, why have we not need of a true Sacrifice, as a teſtimony of our Faith in God, to others?</p>
                        <p>The holy Patriarches had Faith in their Hearts, but did not think themſelves to do ſufficiently by that, their Duty to God, without a Sacrifice as a publick profeſſion to men of this their Faith in him.</p>
                        <p>You muſt diſtinguiſh the condigne, or fully ſatisfying Sacrifice for Sin, from other Sacrifices: That the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father required, and accepted from his Son alone, <hi>in Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices for Sin thou haſt no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then ſaid I</hi> (God the Son) <hi>lo I come, &amp;c.

                        <p>The Maſs was alſo fore-told by the Prophet <hi>Malachie, c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 11. where having reprehended the ancient Preiſts for their offering polluted Sacrifices; God promiſes that a pure Sacrifice ſhall be offered among the Gentils, in theſe words, <hi>from the riſing of the Sun even unto the going down of the ſame my name ſhall be great among the Gentils, and in every place incenſe ſhall be offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my name, and a pure offering.</hi> Which cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but of the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt, which for the Sanctity of the Victime, is called pure, and for the univerſality of the offerers is ſaid to be offered in all places from the riſing to the going down of the Sun. Again its called pure, ſayes the Council of <hi>Trent. Seſs.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. becauſe it cannot be defiled either by the malice or unworthineſs of the Offerers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi>'s interpreting <hi>Malachie</hi> by what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 1. and 15. <hi>v.</hi> 16. is of no force, ſince S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s offering the repenting Gentils, and they their repentance, and the <hi>Romans</hi> the like, or other acts of vertue by which their bodies became living Hoſts breathing the ſervice of God, are only Metaphorical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: Whereas the Prophet foretells a true Sacrifice like to that of the <hi>Iews;</hi> and ſuch is that of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 20. and 21. <hi>The things which the Gentils Sacrifice, they Sacrifice to Devils and not to God, And I would not that you ſhould have Fellow-ſhip with them. (Viz.</hi> eating a part of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44999:54"/>
what they Sacrifice and ſo becoming Participant of their Altar.) For, <hi>Are not they who eat the Hoſts partakers of the Altar,</hi> v. 18. <hi>Ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's Table</hi> (that is Altar) <hi>and of the Table of Devils</hi> to wit eat the Body of Chriſt which we ſacrifice on our Altar and a part of the beaſt which they ſacrifice on theirs. Don't wonder that <hi>S. Paul</hi> calls the Altar <hi>Table,</hi> becauſe on the Altar, on which we Sacrifice, is ſet down to the faithful the Bread of Life and the food of our Souls: ſo the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> called alſo the Altar <hi>Table</hi> chap. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 12. having ſaid before (to the wicked Preiſts) <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Ye offer polluted Bread upon my Altar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Be pleaſed to read this chapter from the 14 verſe to the 22. where the Apoſtle dehorts and fears the Chriſtians from eating of meats offered to Idols, becauſe, who eates of the ſacrifice offered to Idols is partaker of the Altar of Idols or a worſhiper of Idols; as who eates of the altar of Chrſt, and is partaker of the altar of Chriſtians, or a worſhiper of Chriſt; and, as who eates of the altar of the Jews is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the altar of the Jews, or a follower of the Moſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ik law. And conſequently ſince the Chriſtians would not be, nor be thought Idolaters, they ought not to eat of meats offered to Idols.</p>
                        <p>But here take notice, he mentions three tables or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; one, upon which the Gentils ſacrifice to Idols; a ſecond on which the Jews offered victims of beaſts to God; and a third on which Chriſtians offer the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and conſequently this oblation of the Euchariſt in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> opinion is a true ſacrifice, as that of the Jews, and that of the Gentils. But, were offering of the Prayers, and other ſuch acts of vertue Sacrifices; yet they are not the Sacrifice of which Malachy ſpeaks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the yare not pure: not in themſeleves, as Proteſtants avow, nor pure becauſe they are accepted as pure, for, ſay I, their impuritie hinders them to be accepted, it being as much as to offer God polluted Bread upon his Altar, which was rejected <hi>Malach.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7.</p>

                        <p>What the prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> fore-told, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our inſinuated after, <hi>Io.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 19. to the Samaritan Woman: She finding that he was a prophet, propoſed to him the Schiſme which was then between the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and the Jews about the place of Sacrifice. The Samaritans held they ought to Sacrifice upon mount Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razim; the Jews, that they ought all to Sacrifice in the Temple of Jeruſalem. Our Lord gave her a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold anſwer; the firſt as to the place of Sacrifice; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond as to the manner of it. <hi>The hour or time is come,</hi> (that is, will be immediatly after my death) ſays he, <hi>when ye ſhall neither adore</hi> (that is, Sacrifice) <hi>on this mountain nor in Jeruſalem.</hi> (to wit, only) As if he had ſaid hereafter the true adorers, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſtians ſhall not only offer Sacrifice on this montain or in the temple of Jeruſalem, but they ſhall build Churches in everie place to Sacrifice in, as Malachy foretold.</p>
                        <p>Note, by the word <hi>Adore,</hi> is here meant Sacrifice for the Jews did not deny, but that they might adore ſimply and pray God every where; but they held it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Sacrifice but in the Temple of Jeruſalem: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came farr and neer to Jeruſalem, as the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch to adore, that is to Sacrifice <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 27.

In truth contrary to the ſamaritans, who ſacrificed to a falſe God; and in Spirit otherwiſe then thoſe Jews of whom God complained that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him with their mouthes, but that their harts were farr from him. The true adorers then ſhall accompany their outward offering to the true God with an inward devotion of mind.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Authority of the Church, grounded on her infallibility is a ſtrong argument to believe what ſhe aſſerts.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>MY laſt Proof for the Sacrifice of the Maſs is this. The infallible Church of Chriſt hath alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and ſtill believes that in the Euchariſt is the true real Body and Blood of Chriſt, and that in her Liturgy or Maſs is made a true and proper Sacrifice; and therefore I believe it.</p>
                     <p>That the teaching Church of Chriſt is infallible in what ſhe teaches, as matter of Faith, is clear out of the 4. Chapter to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes that <hi>Chriſt made ſome Paſtors and Doctors,</hi> v. 11. Why? <hi>That now we be not Children wavering and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine.</hi> Hence we Infer,</p>
                     <p>Then they are infallible in what they teach us as matter of Faith. For if I thought them fallible, I might ſtill wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, fear and be ready to be carried away with the Wind of another man or Angel's Doctrine, which would make void the ayme of Chriſt, in giving us thoſe Paſtors and Teachers, that we might not waver.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is made manifeſt from Scripture that the teaching Church of Chriſt is infallible; and alſo clear from reaſon, grounded on the ſame Scripture, that this teaching Church is the <hi>Roman.</hi> For ſince no other teaching Church than the <hi>Roman</hi> ſo much as claimes to this infallibility in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44999:59"/>
and infallibility in teaching, muſt be found in ſome Church to make good the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the Scripture in many other places, it follows by a neceſſary conſequence that it is to be found in the <hi>Roman.</hi> And ſo that in the Maſs is made a true Sacrifice, becauſe ſhe has ever; and ſtill aſſerts it.</p>
                     <p>That the taught Church is alſo infallible in her aſſent, to what ſhe is taught by thoſe Paſtors in matter of Faith, or in her receiving their Doctrine is alſo gathered from theſe words of Chriſt ſpeaking to the Church, <hi>he that heares you, heares me, Luc.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 16. for, by that promiſe, if I infallibly aſſent to the Doctrine of Chriſt, I alſo infallibly aſſent to the Doctrine of his Church.</p>
                     <p>If a Proteſtant think he can give ſuch a turne to theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages that they appear to have no force to prove the Churches infallibility.</p>
                     <p>I ask him, if he be infallibly ſure that the Proteſtant Church is the true Church of Chriſt, or not? If not, then what he believes may be falſe, and conſequently it may be falſe that Chriſt is God; in a word he has no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, which is an aſſent to what we believe, for the Teſtimony of God above all, that is, an aſſent ſo ferme, that it ſtands immoveable againſt all the arguments of Men or Angels, <hi>ad Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 8. But the Proteſtant's aſſent is not ſuch, then 'tis not an aſſent of Divine Faith. When Proteſtants ſay they have an objective infallibility, but not ſubjective, that is, that the object of their Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> God, and other Evangelical Truths are in themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, while they the Subjects or Receivers of theſe Truths are fallible; they ſeem to ſay ſomething in words, but in reality they ſay nothing, as to the controverſie in queſtion. For the queſtion is whether a Chriſtian is ſubjectively infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, that is, whether or no his underſtanding be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of an infallible aſſent in matters of Faith, or whether it produces in it ſelf in matter of Faith an aſſent infallible, or which ſtands immoveable againſt what an Angel, not from Hell, but from Heaven, (if that were poſſible) might oppoſe to the contrary; by reaſon of which aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44999:59"/>
the Chriſtian is denominated infallible in his aſſent. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, yes, ſaying altho an Angel from Heaven Evangelize to you beſide that which we have Evangelized to you, he be Curſed. This not ſtanding with Proteſtant principles they muſt either leave them, or avow they are not of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Religion.</p>
                     <p>If he ſayes he is infallibly ſure that the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the true Religion, I ask from whence he has that infallibility? Not from the Church, as he avows; not from the Scripture, as I prove.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe he can't ſo much as Read Scripture in order to know infallibly that the Proteſtant Religion is the true Religion, afore he is infallibly ſure that the Spirit, that Guids him in Reading it, is the true Spirit, (for if it be a falſe Spirit, he will make that appear white, which is black, and black, which is white,) and again he can't know infallibly that 'tis the true Spirit that Guides him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has tryed it by Scripture, <hi>Io.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Thus he muſt know the Scripture by his Spirit, and his Spirit by the Scripture, which is to make a manifeſt Circle, and prove <hi>idem per idem,</hi> the ſame by the ſame, while he proves ultimately that his Spirit is a good Spirit, becauſe it is a good Spirit. Its a good Spirit, ſayes he, becauſe its approved by the Scripture taken in the true ſenſe; and it is the true ſenſe he takes it in, ſayes he again, becauſe his Spirit tells him ſo, which is equivalently to ſay, my Spirit is a good Spirit, ſince none but a good Spirit can aſſure us of the true ſenſe of Scripture. So a 1. <hi>ad ultimum,</hi> from the firſt to the laſt he proves it to be a good Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its a good Spirit, which is ridiculous.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You can't be infallibly ſure from Scripture, that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion is the true Religion, afore you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſure that the ſenſe in which you underſtand it, is the true ſenſe; but of this you can never be infallibly ſure; then you can never be infallibly ſure from Scriptrue, that the Proteſtant Religion is the true Religion.</p>
                     <p>I prove the minor. A Body of Men, (I mean the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholick Doctors,) uſing the ſame means that you
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44999:60"/>
uſe, to know the true ſenſe of Scripture, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it (as we <hi>Romaniſts</hi>) in a ſenſe quite contrary to you, are not according to you infallibly ſure that we have the true ſenſe. Then neither you uſing only the ſame means we uſe, are infallibly ſure that you have the true ſenſe, when you udderſtand it in a ſenſe quite contrary to us.</p>
                     <p>Or tell me what it is, that makes you hit infallibly upon the true ſenſe more than we. If you ſay 'tis this, that you are of the Elect, and the Elect are guided by the Spirit of God, which makes you ſee the Truth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Who told you that you are of the Elect? If you ſay, <q>the Spirit which you have received, gives Teſtimony to your Spirit that ye are the Sons of God, Rom. <hi>8.</hi> v. <hi>16.</hi>

                        <hi>I Anſwer</hi> from <hi>Io. c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1. you ought to try that Spirit, afore ye truſt it, and ſo ye return into your former Circle.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Suppoſe you are of the Elect, ſome of the Elect have not been alwayes guided by the Spirit of God, as <hi>St. Paul:</hi> Nay after he had received the Spirit of God, he was feared to looſe it again, ſaying, <hi>I chaſtiſe my Body and bring it under ſervitude, leſt after I have Preached to others I become a reprobate my ſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 27. How know you then that at this time you are guided by the Spirit of God, eſpecially if it be true that a man knows not whether he be worthy of Love, or hatred? <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.1.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> if you would hear him, would tell you a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way to try your Spirit, to wit, by the Church's appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of it; <hi>Io.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>We (viz.</hi> Governours of the Church) <hi>are of God, he that knows God heares us, (viz.</hi> Governours of the Church) <hi>he that is not of God heares us not, in this we know the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Errour.</hi> To wit, thoſe who are led by the Spirit of Truth, ſubmit themſelves to the Church; whereas thoſe who let themſelves be guided by the Spirit of Errour, will not this ſubmiſſion, but reſt in their own Judgment, and by this wedding themſelves to their own Judgment, they become Hereticks, <hi>being condemned of themſelves,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 11. Other great Sinners are caſt out of the Church by the Governours of the ſame, but the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

he retires or withdraws himſelf by his ſingular and ſelf Judgment, contrary to the Judgment and Sentiment of the Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p>If you ask me what gives a man ſo much ſecurity in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to the Church, as we are adviſed by S. <hi>Iohn c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 6?</p>

                  <p>TO his firſt Argument, ſaying, that Chriſt in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Euchariſt, did not Sacrifice nor offer his Body and Blood to his Father, and that in the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44999:61"/>
and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> there is not the leaſt Foot-ſtep to be ſeen of a Sacrifice, or Oblation of Chriſt's Body and Blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Chriſt was a Preiſt, and in acknoledgment of his Father's Supream Dominion over Life and Death, he put his Body under one Form, <hi>viz. of Bread,</hi> and his Blood under an other ſeparate Form, <hi>viz. of Wine,</hi> upon the Altar, having by Conſecration deſtroyed the Subſtance of Bread and Wine, and ſo offered them to his Father, for them and others, or the Remiſſion of Sins, if we may believe him, ſaying to his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>This is my Body which is given</hi> Greek di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domenon, <hi>for you: Which is broken</hi> kloomenon, <hi>for you: viz.</hi> quoad ſpeciem Sacramenti: <hi>This is my Blood which IS poured out,</hi> Ekkunomenon <hi>for you.</hi> Neither for you only, but for many; was not this an unbloody Sacrifice?</p>
                  <p>Is not there a Foot-ſtep of a Sacrrifice, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of an Altar; which is a correlative of a Sacrifice?</p>
                  <p>He Objects that <hi>Bellar: lib.</hi> 1. of the Maſſe <hi>chap.</hi> 27, confeſſes that the Oblation which is made after Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on belongs to the entireneſs of the Sacrament (<hi>Bellar.</hi> hath Sacrifice) but is not of its eſſence.</p>

                  <p>For Salmeron and Baronius his putting the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt among unwritten traditions. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> They do not deny it to be written alſo. Some things the Apoſtles have delivered to us by <hi>writ, word,</hi> and <hi>practiſe,</hi> as the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and the Baptiſm <hi>adultorum</hi> of <hi>adults</hi> that is, of thoſe who are come to a full age: others only by <hi>word</hi> and <hi>practiſe,</hi> as the Baptiſm of Infants.</p>

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:44999:62"/>The belief of three perſons in the H. Trinity is it only an unwritten tradition? If ſo, and you believe it, why may not you as well believe the unwritten tradition of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs? If you ſay 'tis alſo written. I anſwer. And ſo is the Sacrifice of the Maſs in clearer terms, for which I atteſt your own Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>A ſtrange thing, ſays Mr. <hi>Rodon,</hi> that the Maſs which is the fundation of the Romiſh Church (for the Doctors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nothing of the people but that they ſhould go to Maſs.</p>

So ſay I to him: the ſacrifice of the Maſs is found in ſcripture to have been inſtituted, and practiſed by Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles, <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. <hi>This is my Body which is given for you.</hi> That is, offered to my eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for you, and commanded by Chriſt to his Apoſtles, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> which they did, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>As they miniſtred to the Lord:</hi> the Greek word <hi>leitourgountoon</hi> is turned by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> himſelf <hi>Sacrificing</hi> Remark the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles miniſtred to our Lord when they Sacrificed and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to the People when they gave them the Sacrament.

St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>We have an Altar where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have no right to Eat who ſerve the Tabernacle.</hi> Now an Altar relates to a Sacrifice as I ſaid, ſo ſince <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had Altars in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time they had alſo a Sacrifice: no other but that of the Eucahriſt: then the oblation of it to the eternal Father is a true Sacrifice, ſince a Sacrifice is a viſible offering of a ſenſible thing to God by a Preiſt, <hi>And to eat</hi> relates to the Fuchariſt, not to the Sacrifice of the Croſs. All had right if they pleaſed, <hi>to eate,</hi> that is, to

                  <p>Thus you ſee the Sacrifice of the Maſs is to be found in ſcripture though Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> merited, for his vaniſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in his own thoughts refuſing to ſubmit them to the Church, to have his heart obſeured <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>and to have this Myſterie</hi> (which is revealed only to litle ones, or the Humble) hide from him. <hi>Math.</hi> 11. <hi>v</hi>- 25.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> When St. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 11. ſayes <hi>that Chriſt made ſome Apoſtles,</hi> he mentioned Sacrificers ſufficiently, becauſe to Sacrifice is one of the frunctions of an Apoſtle. Neither doth he mention Baptiſers in that place it being ſufficiently underſtood by his making ſome Paſtors, of whom one duty is to Baptize. Neither had the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writting to <hi>Timothee</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> about the duty of a Biſhop, need to inſtruct them to Sacrifice ſince they had been newly inſtructed as to that, when he made them Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and were now in a daily exerciſe of that function. Moreover <hi>Non valet conſequentia ab authoritate negata, no good tonſequence is drawn from a negative or denyed autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. The thing Sacrificed muſt fall under our ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I grant it; and tell him, That the thing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed is the Sacrament, or Chriſt's Body with the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread, and not Chriſt's Body alone: Which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is not hid, but is viſible by its Species, though a part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Body, be not ſeen; juſt as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44999:63"/>
the Subſtance of Bread viſible by its ſpecies, is not ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Note, then that though the Body of Chriſt is not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnizable (afore the Conſecration) by this viſible Species of Bread; yet the Conſecration being made, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is cognizable to the Faithful by it, becauſe this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies belongs now as much to the Sacrament, being a part of it, as afore it belonged, and was a part of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Bread.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is clear, that the deſtruction or change of the Species ſuffices for the verifying of this propoſition, <hi>The thing Sacrificed is changed or deſtroyed:</hi> For if it were neceſſary to have the whole thing deſtroyed, the Material part as well as the formal part of a thing, there had never been a true Sacrifice: Which to ſay is abſurd. It ſuffices that the whole, or the <hi>totum,</hi> which was before ceaſe to be, by the change which the Preiſt makes of it.</p>
                  <p>You'l ſay: the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſayes the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and that of the Croſs are the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> As to the ſubſtance of the Victime, I grant: As to the manner of Sacrificing or Sacrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I deny.</p>
                  <p>The action by which Chriſt was offer'd on the Croſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers effentially from the action by which he is offer'd in the Sacrament: ſince that was a real diſtruction of the union between the Body and the Soul; this, but a Sacramental one: but a Sacrifice if you regard the thing ſignifying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts chiefly in the Immolating action <hi>Sacrificium exparte rei ſignificantis ex actione immolativa maximè conſtat.</hi> Then if this Immolating action be of a different kind in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Croſs, and that of the Altar; the Sacrifices alſo will be of a different kind, as to the ſacrificing action, though the ſame, as to the thing offered, and the laſt terme ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, which is God as author of Life and Death.</p>
                  <p>Note in the adductive or productive action of Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood is pointed out that two fold dominion of God? <hi>of Death,</hi> by the diſtruction of the Bread and Wine: <hi>Of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44999:63"/>
Life,</hi> by the production of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Note 2. Though bloody or unbloody are accidents to the Body of Chriſt, they are not accidents to a Bloody or Unbloody Sacrifice, as altho Colour be an accident to the Wall, 'tis not an accident to a coloured Wall; ſo that if you deſtroy colour in it, you deſtroy the Eſſence of that whole which was before. <hi>viz.</hi> a coloured Wall.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, firſt that the Sacrifice of the Maſs is not a Sacrifice of an Accident, but of a whole Sacramental being riſing out of Chriſt's Body and the Species of Bread, and that the thing which is deſtroyed in the Sacrifice, is the ſame with that which was produced or made by the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sacrament of the Body of Chriſt under the ſpecies of Bread.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it does not follow that the Sacrifice of the Maſs will be offer'd in the Prieſt's ſtomach only, for the putting of it on the Altar is the offering of it; which is done by the Conſecration, by which alſo the chief part of the thing Sacrificed, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, is Myſteriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Life, while his Body and Blood (if we regard the force of the words only) are put ſeparatly under the ſpecies of Bread and Wine, which Myſtical ſeparation, and putting of him there after a Dead manner; is made ſenſible to us by our hearing the words, or the Prieſt's ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Hoſt, and his laying it on the Altar which is an offering of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have the offering and ſenſible change of the thing offered, which are of the Eſſence of the Sacrifice, afore the conſumption of the Hoſt in the Preiſt's ſtomach; ac in the pacifick Sacrifices of the Old Law, the Victime was offered and killed afore a part of it was conſumed by the Preiſt, and a part by the Perſon who offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>But if you think the ſenſible change of the thing offered in the Euchariſt, is not ſufficiently made afore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Preiſt, then I ſay this change alſo is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently made afore he parts from the Altar; for 'tis not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44999:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the ſpecies be quite deſtroyed, no more then in Libations or Sacrifices of Liquid things. For example, in the effuſion of Wine on the ground, the thing did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ceaſe to be what it was, but ceaſed to be capable of the uſe men make of it, and ſo was looked upon as morally deſtroyed; the ſame I ſay of the ſpecies of the H. Hoſt.</p>

Note: He doth not ſay of <hi>Sins,</hi> for the Remiſſion which was made in the Old Law, by the Blood of Beaſts, was only Remiſſion of a Legal uncleanneſs and temporal Pain, but not of Sin; for 'tis impoſſible, ſayes St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for Sins to be taken away by the Blood of Bulls and Goats, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>It was therefore neceſſary that the Paterus (viz.</hi> the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle or Old Teſtament and People and Preiſts living under them,) <hi>of things in the Heavens,</hi> (that is, of the New Teſtament or the Church of Chriſt, as is clear out of the 8. <hi>chap. v.</hi> 5.) <hi>ſhould be purified with theſe, viz.</hi> Sacrifices of the Old Law, <hi>but the Heavenly things themſelves, viz.</hi> the People of Chriſt, <hi>with better Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, (viz.</hi> that of the Croſs and that of the Maſs, for that on the Croſs was only one) <hi>then theſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> From this paſſage nothing is brought againſt the Maſs, altho the Sins of the Church of Chriſt figured by the Synagogue be ſaid to be purged by Blood, for the Sacrifice of the Maſs affords not a total and compleat Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44999:64"/>
but preſuppoſes the merits of the Blood of Chriſt ſhed on the Croſs, of which it is only an application; and ſo it is true that without the ſhedding of Blood there is no Remiſſion: And thus <hi>Heavenly things, viz.</hi> the Church of Chriſt, <hi>is purified with</hi> more excellent or <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sacrifices, viz.</hi> that of the Croſs meriting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all the Sins of Men, and that of the Maſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this Ranſome of Chriſt to Men. And this is the force of that word <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in the plural number. And don't tell me that the Sacrifice of the Croſs is called <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> in the plural number as Baptiſm, which is but one, is called Baptiſms in the plural number, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 2. For the Baptiſms there mentioned are the three Baptiſms, <hi>viz.</hi> of Water, of Blood, and of the Holy Ghoſt, of which the Catechumens were inſtructed in their Catechiſm, or firſt Leſſons of Chriſtian Doctrine: And theſe are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as to their manner, and remote matter.</p>
                     <p>You Object: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>I will put my Laws into their Hearts and in their minds will I write them, and their Sins and Iniquities will I remember no more, and where Remiſſion of theſe is, there is no more offering for ſin,</hi> and conſequently there is no need of the Sacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I explane the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, in the New Law, I ſhall poure ſuch abundant Graces into the Hearts of ſome, that they ſhall ſo abhor their former Sins, that I ſhall remember them no more; as thoſe of a <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> an <hi>Auſtin,</hi> &amp;c. to puniſh them with eternal fire, and that for the merits of my Son. <hi>Now where Remiſſion of thoſe is, there is no more offering for Sin.</hi> That is, as a new Ranſom, or an other Ranſom than that Chriſt hath given, its true: As an application of that Ranſom given, I deny.</p>
                     <p>I ask doth not God ſtill remember ſo farr the Sins of ſome Elect Proteſtants that he puniſhes them with a temporal Pain? How often do they avow in their Preaching, that they have ſinned, and that the Lord ſcourges them for their Sins? And do not they offer up their faſts and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44999:65"/>
to God on their dayes of Humiliation, to pacific the Lord's Wrath againſt them? And do not they think that they muſt believe and repent that the merits of Chriſt may be applyed to them? Why then do they ſtumble at our Sacrifice or offering in the Maſs not as a new price for our Sins, but as an application of the price given, Chriſt in his Paſſion not having actually applied it to all, who after have by Faith and other conditions required by him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it to themſelves, and ſome in a greater meaſure then others: Unleſs they will not have it true, that, as a Star differs from a Star in Light, Saints differ from Saints in Sanctity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 14. and 42.</p>
                     <p>From the paſſages of St. <hi>Paul, Hebr.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 27. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> Forms theſe Arguments. Firſt, the Sacrifice of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> muſt not be reiterated; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> offereth not himſelf often.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer. Ieſus Chriſt</hi> offereth not himſelf often as the price of the Redemption of Mankind, I grant. As the application of that price to men, I deny. Therefore the Sacrifice of the Maſs, is not the Sacrifice of the Croſs reiterated formally as to the manner and end of it, as ſuch, which was to be the Ranſom for mankind, I grant: It is not the ſame materially as to the Hoſt offered, I deny. Now the reiteration which St. <hi>Paul</hi> denies, is only of the Sacrifice in a Bloody manner which God would have once, (<hi>ſi poſuerit pro peccato animam ſuam, Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>v.</hi> 10.) for the Redemption of man, and no more, becauſe it was ſufficient not only for the Redemption of the men of one age, but all ages paſt and to come: And in this the Sacrifice of Chriſt excells thoſe of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which being weak and unſufficient, one was offered for one Sin, and an other for an other, neither could they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together give a worthy ſatisfaction for one Sin: ſo they were not a Remiſſion, but a commemoration, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 3. that men might remember of their Sins, and know that they were not remitted by the Sacrifices they had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that they ought to recurr to the Croſs and Sacrifice of Chriſt by Faith and hope in him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:44999:65"/>Secondly: The Apoſtle adding <hi>elſe he (viz.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>ſhould often have ſuffered from the Fundation of the World,</hi> makes it appear that Chriſt cannot be offered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Cannot be offered in that manner that <hi>S. Paul</hi> means there, <hi>viz.</hi> as the Price for the Redemption of mankind without ſuffering; its true; becauſe the eternal Father would have that offering in a Bloody way: Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be offered by way of application of that Redemption, I deny. Hence, when the Apoſtle ſayes, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> offered not himſelf often, (underſtand, as the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Sin;) otherwiſe he ſhould often have ſuffered, which is true; becauſe, as I ſaid afore, God would have that offering in a Bloody way.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly. Theſe words <hi>From the Fundation of the World,</hi> ſayes Mr. <hi>Rodon,</hi> are of great weight; for 'tis as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, if the only Sacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſs be not ſufficient to take away ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after, neither was it ſufficient for ſins committed before, and ſo Chriſt ſhould have ſuffered <hi>From the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer. That the Sacrifice of the Croſs was all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to take away all Sins paſt, preſent, and to come, in as much as was, required on Chriſt's ſide, but not in as much as was, and is required on our ſide, as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants muſt grant; becauſe he required our application of thoſe his merits to ourſelves, which Proteſtants make by Faith and Repentance: We by Faith, receiving the Sacraments, Oblation of the Euchariſt commanded by Chriſt, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> and other good works, S. <hi>Paul Coloſ</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 24. ſayes, <hi>I fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> He fill'd up what was wanting, not of Ranſom, but of application of it.</p>

                     <head>SUBSECTION II. His other Inſtances anſwered.</head>
                     <p>TO his fourth Inſtance: I anſwer the ſenſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's compariſon is not that, he fains to himſelf, that Chriſt having died on the Croſs, will be no more upon Earth till he come to Judge the Quick and the Dead; but this: As it is decreed in Heaven for the Sin of the firſt man, that all man Dye and after Death come to Judgment; ſo Chriſt having taken upon him the Sins of all men, would once Dye, offering himſelf as a Ranſom for them, and after come to Judgment, but not with the burden of Sin or as an Hoſt to be offered for them, but as Judge to call them to an accompt of the Favour he had done them, by dying for them, to reward, or puniſh. And thus the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews had no reaſon to be ſcandalized that their <hi>Meſſias</hi> dyed, neither does the Maſs infer that he will come in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhape afore the day of Judgment. But what will Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> ſay, to what is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>The night following, the Lord ſtood by him and ſaid be of good cheer, Paul.</hi> Was not that in human ſhape upon Earth, ſince the Aſcenſion, and afore the day of Judment? And did not St. <hi>Paul</hi> by his appearing ſo to him, prove his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?</p>
                     <p>To his fifth Inſtance: I anſwer. ſacrifices that take away all ſins by way of ranſom for them ought not to be reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that of the Croſs, I grant. Sacrifices which only take away Sins by way of Application of ranſom given for them in the Sacrifice of the Croſs, ought not to be reiterated, as that of the Maſſe, I deny. And in this thoſe two Sacrifices
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44999:66"/>
differ the one being by way of Ranſom in a Bloody manner; the other by way of commemoration for an application of what was purchaſed to us by the Sacrifices of the Croſs: as if a Child who, to move the King to give him ſomething promiſed for his fathers ſake, ſhould ſhow the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Corſelet through which he was ſhot defending his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties perſon. Hence gather that the fruit and efficacy of the Sacrifice of the Croſſe dures for ever, affording us for ever the ranſom of which more or leſſe is applied to men by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Maſs; but the Sacrifice of the Croſs alone without any thing done by men is not ſufficient for our compleat and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sanctification: as appears in the Elect who are not Sanctified at leaſt afore they make an act of Faith.</p>
                     <p>So when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 14. without one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation he conſumated for ever them that are ſanctified, is to be underſtood as much as was required of him as redeam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or on his ſide, that is, <hi>in actu primo,</hi> in a readineſſe for application to be made by us, but not <hi>inactu ſecundo,</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applying his merits, which is done by Baptiſm, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, of Penance and Euchariſt, and (in the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants mind) by Faith.</p>
                     <p>To his laſt inſtance or 16 Numb. Saying That Chriſt was conſtituted high Preiſt for ever.</p>
                     <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. Where there is a High Preiſt there is alſo a Low Preiſt, for High and Low are correlatives and a Low Preiſt muſt have his Sacrifice: No other but that of the Maſs then 'tis a Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 2. That Chriſt hath an unchangeable Preiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that he is able to ſave <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that <hi>Peter</hi> did not ſucceed to him as Eleazarus ſucceeded to Aaron, <hi>viz.</hi> in an equal degree of dignitie of Preiſt-hood, Nay <hi>St. Peter</hi> was not his ſucceſſor, yet he was his Vicar ſupplying his place upon earth, as a Lieutenant does that of his Captain being abſent, which does not hinder Chriſt to be at the ſame time High-Preiſt, and High Preiſt for ever.</p>
                     <p>To his reply to our diſtinctions and ſaying that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs differs eſſentially from the Sacrifice of the Croſs, becauſe the natural death of Chriſt is of the eſſence of this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:44999:67"/>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That if he takes the Sacrifice of the Maſs redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatively as the Sacrifice of the Maſs, it differs eſſentially from the Bloody Sacrifice of the Croſs, though Chriſt, who is the dignifying part in both the Sacrifices be offered in both.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Album as Album</hi> formally and reduplicatively taken differs eſſentially from the wall which is white; becauſe white enters neceſſarily into the conception of a white thing &amp; not into the conception of the wall. So a Sacrifice offered only by way of application, differs eſſentially from the ſame thing offered by way of ranſom; becauſe Ranſom enters the conception of the one, and Application the conception of the other. But the Council of Trent doth not take it ſo, but that the ſame Chriſt is offered in both: neither will the Council have it a meer repreſentation of the Sacrifice of the Croſſs, as a picture repreſents the King; for, the ſame Chriſt is really offer'd in the Maſs who was offered on the Croſs, though not in the ſame manner, nor preciſely for the ſame end: neither is it a meer application for the ſame reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Does a young Prince repreſenting unto his Father upon a ſtage how he faught in the field differ as to his eſſence or natural being from himſelf in the field? No, but only in the manner of being or repreſentative being. And ſo what is offered in the Maſs differs not eſſentially from what was offered on the Croſs.</p>
                     <p>You'l ſay: the Sacrifice of the Croſs is of an infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and hath force to take away all ſins, and therefore there is no need to reiterate it in the Maſs.</p>
                     <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> diſtinguiſhing the antecedent <hi>in actu primo,</hi> that is, in a power applyable, I grant, <hi>in actu ſecundo,</hi> that is, in a power applyed, I deny. I hope Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> will not ſay the Sacrifice of the Croſs takes away all Sin <hi>in actu ſecundo,</hi> that is, actually applyes Chriſt's merits to all men: for ſo there would be no reprobate, none damned.

fit to the Prieſt according to his diſpoſition and capacity.</p>
                     <p>Note. 2. Sins remitted by the Sacrifice of the Maſs were expiated by the Sacrifice of the Croſs <hi>in actu primo,</hi> but the expiation was not yet applyed <hi>in actu ſecundo,</hi> and this is done in the Sacrifice of the Maſs A number of ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections you may eaſily ſolve by what I have ſaid before in this chapter.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> ſayes the application of the Croſs may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered on God's part and Man's part: on God's part when he offers Jeſus Chriſt to us withall his benefits both in his words and Sacraments: on Man's part, when by a true lively faith working by love we embrace Jeſus Chriſt with all his merits offered to us both in his word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, we find Chriſt offered <hi>for us. Luke.</hi> 22. and that was the firſt Sacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly. On God's part all was done by Jeſus Chriſt's offering; on our part, our application is indeed by faith operating by good works, one of which is our aſſiſtance and offering with the Preiſts in the Sacrifice of the Maſs: The Plaiſter indeed for our Spiritual wounds is Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood, the application is made by ſaith joyned to good works, of which the cheif is the Sacrifice of the Maſs. but to believe only, as I have ſaid ſo often, is not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient recourſe or application of our Spiritual Plaiſter, or a ſufficient laying of it on our wound. Not every on who ſayes Lord Lord <hi>&amp;c. Math.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 21. Faith is only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition requiſite with the works.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Rhodon</hi> remarks that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> chap. 3. doth not ſay <hi>whoſoever ſacrifices him viz.</hi> Chriſt, in the Maſs, but <hi>whoſoever believes, &amp;c. ſhall have life everlaſting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Whoſoever believs as he ſhould do, I grant; for ſuch an one will alſo do what Chriſt commanded to be done; if he be a Preiſt he will offer the Sacrifice of the Maſs. If he preciſely believs and no more, which may be done, I deny: he who only cryes upon Chriſt Lord, Lord, believ's Chriſt dyed for him, otherwiſe he would not call him Lord;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44999:68"/>
yet he will not enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, becauſe he doth not add to his belief good works, or do the will of the Eternal Father. <hi>Math.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 21. I alſo heartily bold with St. <hi>Paul</hi> that God hath ſet forth <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation through faith in his Blood, and that ſaith in the Blood of Chriſt is the beginning and diſpoſition to propitiation to our Sins, <hi>Snitium ſubſtantiae,</hi> as he terms it <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>The beginning of our ſpiritual ſubſiſting,</hi> but it alone will not do the turne; ſo this does not exclude the Sacrifice of the maſs ſo much ſpoken of in other places.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the concluſion of his tenth article, P. 3. <hi>queſt.</hi> 82. he tells Preiſts, they muſt celebrate on the chief feaſts principally in order to God, to whom Sacrifice is offer'd in the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euchariſt, warning them of what is ſaid to Preiſts. 2. <hi>Machab.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Ita ut ſacerdotes</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that Preiſts did not apply themſelvs now to their duty about the Altar but flighting the Temple and neglecting the Sacrifices</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the concluſion of the cited article by Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> aſſignes two wayes by which the Maſs may be called a Sacrifice. The firſt, becauſe it repreſents the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Croſs, as the Picture of Cicero. The ſecond, becauſe by this Sacrament we are made participant of the fruit of our Lord's Paſſion. As to the firſt, ſayes he, Chriſt was Sacrificed in the Figures of the old Law, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the ſlaughter of Abel, (<hi>viz.</hi> repreſentatively only.) But as to the ſecond 'tis proper to the Sacrament
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44999:68"/>
                        <hi>quod in ejus celebratione Chriſtus immoletur, becauſe in its celebration Chriſt is immolated.</hi> Note, he was immolated improperly in the firſt, then, that the ſecond may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the firſt, in it he is Sacrificed properly. And ad 2. in the ſame article he ſayes we muſt ſay, that as the celebration of this Sacrament is a repreſentative Image of the paſſion of Chriſt, ſo the Altar is a repreſentative of the Croſs <hi>t</hi> In which Chriſt in his own form was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated. Note that Altar in the Maſs relates to a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. So if Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> will ſubſcribe to St. Thoma's Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine touching the Maſs he will acknowledge both that in it Bread and Wine are changed into the Fleſh and Blood, (<hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſt) and that it is a true Sacrifice in which he is <hi>Sacrificed in an other's ſhape</hi> or the Form of Bread.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A reply to Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi>'s anſwers to ſome of our Proofs, both for the Real preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt, and the Sacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
               </argument>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECTION. I. For the Real Preſence. Our firſt Proof.</head>
                  <p>OUr Proof that theſe words, <hi>This is my Body: This is my Blood,</hi> ſhould be taken in their proper ſenſe, and not figuratively is this, becauſe men, (<hi>viz.</hi> wiſe men, ſuch as eminently Chriſt was,) making their Teſtament, ſpeak plain.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon,</hi> to uſher in more ſmoothly his anſwer, ſayes firſt, That Articles of Faith and Sacraments, are not always expreſſed in proper terms, and buſies himſelf
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44999:70"/>
to anſwer that which is not ſo much as thought upon to be denied, much leſs Objected. Then he ſayes: I anſwer, that in H. Scripture, Teſtaments are not always expreſſed in proper terms without a figure; for the Teſtament of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 49. and <hi>Moyſes, Deut.</hi> 33. are nothing but a chain of Metaphors and other figures; and <hi>Civilians</hi> will have, that in Teſtaments we ſhould not regard the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification of the words, but the intention of the Teſtator.</p>
                  <p>I reply: What he brings for Teſtaments in thoſe places are Prophecies of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Moyſes,</hi> not Teſtaments: Nay, after <hi>Iacob</hi> had fore-told all, the text adds he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed every one with their proper bleſſings, of which in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular the Scripture is ſilent, and ordered them to bury him in the Field of <hi>Ephon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe they had been Teſtaments there was a ſpecial reaſon for ſpeaking in covered terms; firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were at leaſt alſo Prophecies, which the Holy Ghoſt would not have yet clearly underſtood by every one, but that they ſhould have their recourſe to the Preiſts for the underſtanding of them; thus keeping the People in humility, and the Governours of the Church in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Next, there was no danger of any one's looſing his right by others mis-underſtanding of the words, becauſe <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Moyſes</hi> were infallibly ſure of God's promiſe. But in Chriſt's Teſtament there was a reaſon of making the words clear, to encourage men to be earneſt to get what he had left them.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſaying of <hi>Civilians,</hi> That in Teſtaments we ſhould not regard the proper ſignification of the words, but the Intention of the Teſtator.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, the reaſon is, becauſe it falls out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that Teſtaments conceaved in proper words are ambiguous; for example; ſuppoſe a man who hath two Nephews, one the Son of a Poor man, to whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways teſtified Love above the other, who was the Son of a Rich man, ſhould Teſt thus: I leave 100. <hi>lib.</hi> to my Nephew: Here the Intention of the Teſtator is to be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44999:70"/>
attended, and by this adjudged to the poor Nephew by reaſon of his ſingular affection to him; altho the proper ſignification of the word pleads as much for the other.</p>
                  <p>If you ask me, how in the beſt conceived Teſtaments there may be ſome thing ambiguous?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> becauſe, <hi>Res ſunt innumerae &amp; pauca verba,</hi> that is, <hi>Things are without number but words are few,</hi> and ſo by one word we muſt ſignifie many things.</p>
                  <p>He urges: Chriſt did not then make the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only the ſign of it, for the Covenant was made with all mankind in the Perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> after the fall, when God promiſed him that the ſeed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpent's Head; and was after renewned in <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt. Whatſoever was made in the Old Law, is not that which our Saviour in the Ghoſpel calles the New Teſtament, for all that was Old, when he ſpoke: Nay, the New Teſtament was not the ſame Covenant made in the Perſon of Adam, for if the New Teſtament was made with Adam, and renewed with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> I ask who was that afore <hi>Adam</hi> with whom the Old Teſtament was made? Item, different conditions make a different Covenant. Now, to believe in CHRIST COME and TO USE HIS SACRAMENTS are conditions which were not in the former.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I deny that he did not make at the laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per his New Teſtament, becauſe, as by God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. the Old Teſtament was made, or his will of giving to the Jews the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> if they kept his commandments and ceremonies preſcribed by him; was made, I ſay, and ſigned with the Blood of Beaſts, <hi>Hic eſt ſanguis fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris quod pepigit vohiſcum Deus: This is the Blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you.</hi> Said <hi>Moyſes:</hi> ſo Chriſt by the effuſion of his Blood in a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, (for Liquid things are offered by Effuſion) made and ſigned his New Teſtament of giving us ſpiritual things and a heavenly inheritance, if we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44999:71"/>
and uſe the Sacraments inſtituted by him.</p>
                  <p>And now I prove that he made it here and no where elſe: Becauſe here, and no where elſe he fulfilled the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required in a Teſtator making his Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſignified that he was making his Teſtament in theſe words, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, Luke</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he promiſed and left ſome thing to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors, he promiſed Remiſſion of Sins to his Apoſtles, and <hi>many,</hi> or to the Jews in the word <hi>vobis,</hi> and to the Gentils in the word <hi>multis,</hi> ſo called, becauſe they were truly many in reſpect of the litle number of the Jews; and left them his Body and Blood to be offered for that end.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ordered ſome thing to be done by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhould love one another: As God in the Old Teſtament propoſed by <hi>Moyſes</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He did it afore witneſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Church, or all the Apoſtle, who knew he was making his Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Here he was in a living condition at the ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Teſtament, not ſo at the Croſs. Hence avow, that at our Lords Supper the New Teſtament was made, and the figure of the Old fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quaeres.</hi> Did he ſpeak plain when he ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of this Cup?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Grant he did not, that was not of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sacrament: Next, a figurative ſpeach, ſo commonly uſed, that it would be odd to underſtand it otherwiſe then in the ſenſe of the ſpeaker, is <hi>aequivalent</hi> to a proper ſpeach. CUP, hath two ſignifications by the inſtitution of men: Taken alone, it ſignifies a certain Veſſel; joyned to DRINK, it ſignifies the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>Note: Altho we ſay he ſpoke without figure in inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting this Sacrament, as it is ſet down by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> who alone of all the Evangeliſts, that relate to us the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44999:71"/>
inſtitution, was preſent: We do not ſay that he ſpoke always ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> The Apoſtles asked Chriſt the meaning of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, why did not they ask the meaning of theſe words which carried ſuch ſtrange conſequences, as one Body to be in diverſe places at once? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> He had cleared them ſufficiently by what he ſaid in the 6. Chap. of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſo that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> having ſpoken of it there, does not ſo much as mention it afore his Paſſion, nor any Diſciple ſeemed to wonder, hearing the words of the Inſtitution; altho many of the Diſciples afore, <hi>Io.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 61. had ſaid, <hi>This ſpeach is hard, and who can hear it?</hi> They were wiſer, after they had heard what he ſaid, <hi>Io.</hi> 6. than to ſay with the <hi>Capharnaites, How can he give us his Fleſh to Eat?</hi> Or with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, How can he be at once in two places?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> 1. The Types of the Old Teſtament were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, that the Faithful of thoſe times might come to the knowledge of the things Typiſied and ſignified in the New; but thoſe of the Old Teſtament never came to the knowledge of the Euchariſt by the Paſchal Lamb; then the Paſchal Lamb was not a Type of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> They were not inſtituted only for that reaſon, but alſo, that we in the New Law might underſtand that we are one and the ſame Church with them, they having had at leaſt in Figure, and conſequently an obſcure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what we have in reality: And ſo the Paſchal Lamb was a Figure of the Euchariſt, altho the <hi>Iews</hi> came not by it to a knowledge of the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. The Paſſover was a Type, and the Euchariſt is alſo a Type of Chriſt, Therefore, if the Paſſover had been a Type of the Euchariſt, it had been a Type of a Type, and not of a thing Typified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> A bare Type may be the Type of that which is not a bare Type. So the Paſchal Lamb was a Type of the Euchariſt, which in one reſpect is the thing Typified, and in an other the Type: The thing Typified in reſpect of the Paſchal Lamb; and a Type in reſpect of Chriſt's Death, which it repreſents. So alſo the Paſchal Lamb was in one reſpect a true Sacrifice, and in an other it was the Type of the Sacrifice of Chriſt made in the Euchariſt, and on the Croſs.</p>

                  <p>GOD can put two Bodies in one place; then he may put one Body in two places, or at once in Heaven, and in the Hoſt. The antecedent is proven by Chriſt's entring into the Canacle of the Apoſtles, <hi>the doors being ſhut. Io.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi>'s anſwer, is to explane thoſe words, thus, <hi>The doors having been ſhut,</hi> which explication ſuffers the opening of them; again, to let Chriſt in. But that which annull's all his frivolous explications of thoſe words, is, that the Greek Original text has <hi>thuroon kekleisménoon,</hi> in the Genetive abſolute, <hi>the doors being ſhut:</hi> and the Engliſh Proteſtant Tranſlation, has, <hi>when the doors were ſhut came Ieſus:</hi> Both which import a <hi>ſimultaneus</hi> entry of <hi>Ieſus</hi> with the door's being ſhut: or that <hi>Ieſus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred while the doors were ſhut, and conſequently, <hi>two Bodies were penetratively in the ſame place.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> anſwers: That is to be underſtood <hi>improperly,</hi> that is, that the Heavens gave way to his Body as the Air to an Arrow. But I reply: The Holy Scripture is to be taken in the litteral ſenſe, when ſo taken (as here,) it implies no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, nor any thing againſt Faith, or good manners. Moreover St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke ſo, to let us know, that <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability</hi> or <hi>ſubtility,</hi> is one of the Gifts or Endowments of a Glorious Body.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> objects Numb. 15. That a modal accident (in the opinion of thoſe Romiſh Doctors who hold them) cannot be without a ſubject; therefore the Species of Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt, cannot be without a Subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I deny the conſequence, becauſe the <hi>Modal Accident,</hi> in the opinion of thoſe who hold them; is <hi>jultima rei determinatio,</hi> it ultimatly determines its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ect; and conſequently when it exiſts, it is with its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: But other Accidents, as the Species of Bread or Wine as Colour, Savour, &amp;c. do not ultimately or actually determine a Subject, but only have naturally an appetite to be in a Subject; ſo Fire naturally has an appetite to burn, yet, by Divine power its actual burning was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the Furnace of <hi>Babilon.</hi>

                  <p>What he ſays about the word <hi>New</hi> offering is out of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for we have not that word in our Bible, but only <hi>Oblatio munda, a pure offering.</hi> Only let his Defender take notice; that Sacrifices are not acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt, unleſs the Offerers be living ſtones, or living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church by Grace, 1. <hi>Pet. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5.

                  <p>WHich Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> anſwers, is taken from theſe words. <hi>Melchiſedech King of Salem bringing forth Bread and Wine (for he was a Breiſt of God the moſt High) bleſſed him,</hi> Gen. 14.18.</p>
                  <p>From theſe words according to the unanimous conſent of Greek and Latin Fathers whoſe paſſages you may read in <hi>Bellarm.</hi> lib. 1. <hi>de miſſa. chap.</hi> 6. We ſay 1. That Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech Sacrificed there, 2. That the cheif difference between the Sacrifice of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and that of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> made there, was in this, that <hi>Aaron's</hi> was Bloody, and <hi>Melchiſedech's</hi> Unbloody, or in Bread and Wine; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince Chriſt, according to David, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. and St. <hi>Paul, Hebr.</hi> 7. is called a Preiſt after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi> and not after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> v. 11. expreſſely intimates, it behoved him to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice under the formes of Bread and Wine, as he did at the laſt Supper, when having changed a peece of Bread into his Body, he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body which is given</hi> (that is, <hi>offered) for you,</hi> and <hi>This is the Cup the New Teſtament in my Blood which is poured out</hi> (that is <hi>Sacrificed) for you, Luke</hi> 22. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the oblation which is made in the Maſs (it being the ſame with that which Chriſt made at the laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) is a true Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>An other difference taken from the Perſon Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, is that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> neither ſucceeded to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44999:75"/>
any in his Presſtly dignity, being without Father and Mother in order to his Preiſt-hood which he had not carnally by right of Inheritance, but was the firſt of that order, neither had he a Succeſſor, as <hi>Aaron</hi> had <hi>Eleazer,</hi> and in this he was a Type of Chriſt a Preiſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rhodon</hi> to weaken this our Argument for the Sacrifice of the Maſs, from theſe words, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Melchiſedech King of Salem bringing forth Bread and Wine, (for he was a Preiſt of God the moſt High) bleſſed him.</hi> Says, we falſifie the Text in three places putting the Participle <hi>Bringing</hi> for <hi>brought,</hi> the cauſal <hi>For</hi> for <hi>And.</hi> and leaving out another <hi>And.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I freely avow, our Tranſlation does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Hebrew Text word for word. Is a Tranſlator bound to more than the true, and full ſenſe of what he Tranſlates? May not he change an active Verb into a Paſſive, a Verb into a Participle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If I ſhould tranſlate the French, <hi>Jay froid,</hi> thus, <hi>I have cold,</hi> would not I be rediculous to an Engliſh man who ſays, <hi>I am cold?</hi> Do not the <hi>Grecians</hi> who are lovers of Participles ſay hanſomely by a Participle, that which in Latin we ſay by a Verb? St. <hi>Ierom</hi> then knowing the meaning of the H. Ghoſt in that Paſſage, by the ſentiment of the Church and all the H. Fathers, did not ſtick to the words in his Latin Tranſlation, but gives us neatly the ſenſe. But Proteſtants in their Tranſlation diſturb the ſenſe, making the words <hi>and was a Preiſt</hi> relate to <hi>and he bleſſed him,</hi> whereas they relate to the words going afore, and therefore we turn this Particle <hi>Vau,</hi> which ſignifies both <hi>For</hi> and <hi>and, For.</hi> Now here is the reaſon why the words <hi>For,</hi> or <hi>And he was a Preiſt</hi> relate to the former words, <hi>viz. Brought forth Wine and Bread,</hi> becauſe in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Text after theſe words <hi>For,</hi> or <hi>And he was a Preiſt</hi> is put the accent, which the Hebrews call <hi>Soph Paſuch,</hi> which ſignifies that the period is ended there.</p>
                  <p>Note, more over 1. It makes the ſame ſenſe whether you ſay, <hi>Bringing forth Bread he bleſſed him, or He
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44999:75"/>
brought forth bread (viz.</hi> to Sacrifice) <hi>becauſe he was a Preiſt) and bleſſed him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, 2. The word <hi>proferens bringing,</hi> or according to the Hebrew word <hi>hotſi,</hi> that is, <hi>brought,</hi> tho of it ſelf ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing but <hi>bringing</hi> or <hi>brought,</hi> yet oftentimes for the exigence of the place it is uſed to ſignify the bringing of the Hoſt to be Sacrificed: as <hi>Iud</hi> 6.18. And we take it ſo here, for the reaſon I'le bring by and by in the ſixth note.</p>
                  <p>Note, 3. Altho the Hebrew has <hi>Vau,</hi> that is <hi>And</hi> he was a Preiſt that makes nothing; becauſe <hi>Vau</hi> is taken moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as <hi>Ballarmine</hi> remarks for the cauſal <hi>ki,</hi> that is, <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>becauſe,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.5. <hi>The Sea is his AND he made it,</hi> St. <hi>Ierome turnes, BECAUSE he made it.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Thou art angry AND we have ſinned,</hi> ſayes the Hebrew and Greek and Latin, tho the Proteſtant Bible tranſlates <hi>For,</hi> that is, <hi>becauſe we have ſinned.</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou art but a dead Man for the Woman's ſake which thou haſt taken FOR ſhe is a Man's Wife:</hi> the Hebrew has <hi>Vau i. e.

                  </p>
                  <p>And he bleſſed him, <hi>viz. Melchiſedech</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> not as a Preiſt, but as a greater Perſon, for <hi>Abraham</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Preiſt and had often Sacrificed.

                  <p>You Object in theſe words <hi>Bleſſed Him</hi> the Relative <hi>Him</hi> relates to the Perſon to whom the Bread was offered; but 'twas <hi>Abraham</hi> he bleſſed; then the Bread was offered only to <hi>Abraham,</hi> not to God, and conſequently there was no Sacrifice.</p>

To ſhew that Chriſt was a Preiſt for ever according to that order, <hi>viz.</hi> by his Sacrificing under the formes of Bread and wine till the end of the world, how can he ſay that 'tis a manifeſt falſification? to me its a manifeſt falſification in him when he ſayes in the ſame <hi>Num.</hi> that the greek ſeptuagint tranſlate it as Proteſtants do, <hi>and he was a Preiſt;</hi> for the <hi>London</hi> Edition of the Septuagint 1653. by <hi>Roger Daniel</hi> has <hi>eën de hiereus but</hi> or <hi>for</hi> he was a Preiſt, not <hi>and</hi> he was a Preiſtj for the particle <hi>de</hi> ſignifies not only <hi>but;</hi> but alſo <hi>gar,</hi> that is, <hi>for</hi> in good Engliſh as <hi>Henricus Stephanus</hi> tell us in his Greek Dictionary when he comes to that particle.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44999:77"/>
to tell the truth I have not by me the old Latin interpreter to ſee his expreſſion, and therefore I will not contradict Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> in that.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay Chriſt is a Preiſt for ever becauſe he remaines for ever.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That remaining for ever makes him capable to do the function of a Preiſt <hi>for ever</hi> be being a Preiſt, but that alone does not make him a Preiſt for ever, no more then it makes an Angel, who will remain for ever, <hi>a Preiſt for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither can you ſay that he is a Preiſt <hi>for ever</hi> becauſe the vertue of his Sacrifice on the Croſs remaines for ever. For the vertue of the Sacrifice of Noë which obtained that no more deluge ſhould come upon the Earth for ever <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 8. ſo remaines or dures for ever, yet I hope you will not ſay that Noë is a Preiſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>Would you ſay at the death of a man, whom the King makes Lord Chief Juſtice, and deprives him of his office at the years end, he living yet 19. years after, he was Lord Cheif Juſtice 20. years? No; becauſe he did the function of a Cheif Juſtice only one year.</p>
                  <p>No more could we ſay that Chriſt is a Preiſt for ever, if he did not do the function of a Preiſt for ever. And the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Preiſt, according to St. <hi>Paul, Hebr.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 3. is to offer: <hi>every High Preiſt is ordained to offer Gifts and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, wherefore it is of neceſſity that this man (viz.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>have ſome what alſo to offer.</hi> He ſpeak's not here of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, as if it were the proper partial function of a Preiſt, by reaſon of which Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> would have Chriſt called a Preiſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay with <hi>Calvin, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Inſt. cap.</hi> 18. he offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Heaven. I ask; is that oblation made in Heaven a proper Sacrifice? If ſo, then the Chriſtian Religion is no more upon Earth but tranſlated to Heaven, becauſe <hi>The Preiſt-hood being tranſlated, there is made of neceſſity</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, Hebr.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>A tranſlation alſo of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note 8. Chriſt is not called a Preiſt for ever becauſe he intercedes for ever; for to intercede is common to a Preiſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44999:77"/>
and other men: but becauſe he Sacrifices for ever. That is, to the end of the World the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt, of which he is the chief offerer.</p>
                  <p>Note 9. Altho it was not neceſſary we ſhould know how <hi>Melchiſedeth</hi> executed his Kingly Office, yet is was neceſſary we ſhould know how he exerciſed his Preiſt-hood; becauſe he is not mentioned to have had aſpecial Kingſhip, but he is mentioned to have had a ſpecial Preiſt-hood. And becauſe no mention is made in the Scriptures of the end of his Preiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood more than of the end of his Life, he is called in them a Preiſt for ever, and in that, a figure of Chriſt's Preiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood for ever, but not that he was truely a Preiſt for ever, as Chriſt. So he is ſaid to have been without a Father or Mother, not, that truely he was ſo, but only without Parents mentioned in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> in his laſt anſwer <hi>num.</hi> 28. ſayes, its falſe that the difference between the Preiſt-hood of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and that of <hi>Aaron</hi> did conſiſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Aaron</hi> offered the bloody Sacrifices of Beaſts, and <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> offered an unbloody Sacrifice of Bread and Wine; Alſo he ſayes its falſe, that the likeneſs of the Preiſt-hood of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> to that of JESUS doth conſiſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That as <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech</hi> did Sacrifice Bread and Wine; ſo JESUS did Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his Body and Blood, under the Species of Bread and Wine. And that theſe are human inventions, neither founded on Scripture or Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> They are not human inventions, ſince they are grounded on Scripture, as the Church and Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it; againſt whoſe Authority, if Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> thinks his bare aſſertion is of ſufficient force, I may ſay in French, Mr. <hi>Rodon radote,</hi> or <hi>deviats from the right tract.</hi> As to that he ſayes, That the Apoſtle writing to the Hebrews places the difference between the Preiſt-hood of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech</hi> and that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and its likeneſs to that of Chriſt in quite another thing then in that we alleadge; this I deny, and grant, that he places the difference of the Perſon of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> from that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſome likeneſs of the Perſon of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> with that of CHRIST, in quite
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44999:78"/>
an other thing, but not the difference of the Preiſt-hood of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> from that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or the likeneſs of the Preiſt hood of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> to that of JESUS in other things, than thoſe which are aſſerted by the Roman Church. St. <hi>Paul</hi> is here ſilent of both, as to their formal difference or likneſs, for a reaſon which I ſhall bring by and by.</p>
                  <p>By this that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> receives tithes from <hi>Abraham</hi> and bleſſes him, he is declared by the Apoſtle to be a greater Perſon then <hi>Abraham,</hi> but by this is not ſignified the difference of his Preiſt-hood from that of <hi>Aaron</hi> and others, who were yet in the Loines of <hi>Abraham;</hi> by that alſo that he was a King, and a King of Peace, the greater likeneſs of his Perſon than that of <hi>Aarons,</hi> to CHRIST, is intimated, but not the likeneſs of his Preiſt-hood.</p>
                  <p>If you ask me why the Apoſtle does not here aſſign for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and openly the difference between the Sacrifice of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> and that of <hi>Aaron:</hi> And the reſemblance of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi>'s with that of Chriſt in the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>My anſwer is, that the controverſie between the incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Jews and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was not about that difference or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, (and beſides by reaſon of their incredulity &amp; weakneſs, they were not capable of underſtanding the Myſtery of the Euchariſt) but whither or no all the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his order were ſufficient for the general redemption and ſatisfaction for the Sins of all mankind; and he anſwers, no, and ſayes, that they had need of a greater Sacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Croſs, and a greater Perſon to be Preiſt, figured by <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> who was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently above <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and who was to be a Preiſt for ever, <hi>viz.</hi> by the proper act of Preiſt-hood, that is, was to Sacrifice till the end of the World, (which is not done by <hi>a perpetual interceſſion,</hi> unleſs it be joined to a Sacrifice and ſo makes one thing with it, for a pure Interceſſion is not the proper act of a Preiſt.) And this was fore-told by <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 109. <hi>Thou art a Preiſt for ever after the Order of Melchiſedech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet he intimated the difference of <hi>Melchiſedechs</hi> Sacrifice from that of <hi>Aaron</hi> ſufficiently to the Faithful, (<hi>Sapientia
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44999:78"/>
pauca,</hi> a word ſuffices to thoſe who know the thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,) when he ſpoke of his Preiſt-hood, condiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from that of <hi>Aaron</hi> (becauſe a ſpecial Preiſt-hood cannot be conceived without the ſpecial Sacrifice to which it has a reference.</p>
                  <p>Note 1. 'Tis indifferent to Preiſt-hood to have been a King or not: to have one's Birth mentioned or not; alſo 'tis not the proper act of Preiſt-hood <hi>to bleſs,</hi> but only becauſe Preiſt-hood is a dignity above all human dignity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis given to the Preiſt to Bleſs, his proper act being <hi>to Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note 2. From theſe words of St. <hi>Paul, If then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation was by the Levitical Preiſt-hood,</hi> (for under it the People received the Law,) that the People of God were made a Lawful Community under God by the Preiſt-hood, by meanes of which they adored God as he deſired: ſo that the Preiſt-hood altering, the Law altered, they being annexed or tyed together.</p>
                  <p>Note 3. The Old Preiſt-hood and its Sacrifices were not tranſlated into the Preiſt-hood and Sacrifice of the Croſs, as the only Preiſt-hood and Sacrifice of the New Law; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at this Sacrifice, all People could not be preſent to acknowledge God's ſupream Dominion all the time of the New Law, as People were preſent at the <hi>Levitical</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices during the Old Law; ſo then the Levitical Priſt-hood of which St. <hi>Paul, Hebr.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 12. was tranſlated into the Preiſt-hood after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sacrifices into the Sacrifices of the Chriſtian Church made in the Eechariſt, as the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law was tranſlated into the Chriſtian Law. Did not the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. <hi>Cap.</hi> 61. <hi>v.</hi> 6. That there ſhould be Preiſts in the New Law, and can Preiſts be without proper Sacrifices? And are there any proper Sacrifices in the Chriſtian Church if that of the Maſs be not a true Sacrifice?</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rodon</hi> concludes his Book with this Argument: <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> hath offered no Sacrifice, but after the Order whereof he was eſtabliſhed a Preiſt: Hence he concludes that according to us, he has offered no Sacrifice but that of the Maſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:44999:79"/>
                     <hi>Anſwer. Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hath offered no Sacrifice <hi>for ever,</hi> but that of the Maſs, I grant, no other Sacrifice <hi>for once,</hi> I deny. Again: He was only eſtabliſhed a Preiſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Order of <hi>Melchiſedech for ever,</hi> I grant: <hi>for once,</hi> I deny; and ſay, that this Order <hi>for once,</hi> was a ſpecial one for the ſole Sacrifice of Redemption. Yet the Sacrifice of the Croſs may be alſo call'd, <hi>according to the Order of Melchiſedech</hi> in a good ſenſe, becauſe he who made it was a Preiſt after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedech:</hi> As a French Sermon made by an Engliſh man, may be call'd an Engliſh piece, <hi>viz.</hi> a piece proceeding from an Engliſh man.</p>

            <p>NOw to end this little work, I wiſh Proteſtants may weigh the force of our Proofs in Order to believe, and <hi>Catholicks</hi> meditate the ſame in Order to be fervent in the daily practiſe of what they believe. St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> in his traitiſe of the preparation to Maſs, will have the Preiſt come to the Altar, not only all a fire, but alſo wholly crucified <hi>totus ignitus,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>&amp; totus cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixus:</hi> All burning with the Love of this Lovely Lord, poſſeſſed with a ſtrong apprehenſion of his Death and an equal feeling of his pain. Such pain in the Preiſt and all the aſſiſting offerers, may be well joyned with an exceſſive Joy to ſee themſelves, have a hand in giving God at that moment the greateſt honour all his grandour can receive. If it was a great honour to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour, landing at the Town of <hi>Naples</hi> to have had all the way layd with Cloath of Gold from the Ship to the Palace: What an honour is given to God, when in this Myſtery, not Gold and Silver is troden underfoot, but a Divine Perſon equal to himſelf is Sacrificed to honour him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:44999:79"/>May the offerers look for little from the Perſon who is honoured with ſuch a Gift? We know the more holy was the ſacrificer among the ancient Patriarches, and the more Noble was his Victime, the more favourably was both looked upon by God: <hi>reſpexit Dominus ad Abel &amp; nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera ejus,</hi> ſayes <hi>Moyſes, Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 4. God, who frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Cain,</hi> had a complacence both for the Perſon of <hi>Abel</hi> and his Gifts: Now, what was the ſanctity of <hi>Abel</hi> to that of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and <hi>Abels</hi> offering to his?</p>
            <p>What may then they who with a lively faith are preſent at this Sacrifice expect from Heaven. ſince Chriſt makes over to them, all, with which his father for this Sacrifice might liberally acknowledge him? ſee <hi>Conc. Trid. Seſs.</hi> 22. can. 2. a great meaſure of grace in order to a full repentance, and a great remiſſion of pain due to Sin, great lights to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the more perfect way to Salvation: great ſtrength to walk and perſever therein. But mind always that, <hi>Juſtus ex fide vivit,</hi> as all our ſpiritual Life ſprings firſt from faith, ſo it grows not to perfection without the ſame. Let us then endeavour never to come to this fountain of all good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a lively one.</p>
